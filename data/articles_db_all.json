        "text": "As the world commemorates the International Veterinary Day today, veterinary professionals are raising the red flag over the rise in Johne's disease, an incurable fatal ailment.\nDr Joseph Omega, a veterinary surgeon, says there is increased incidence of the Johne's disease (or paratuberculosis), which is prevalent in Kenya because most livestock farmers are either ignoring advice offered or they are not bothering to involve vets.\nJohne's disease is caused by a bacterium-Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis- that is in the same family as the one that causes the human tuberculosis.\nDomestic animals (mostly sheep and cattle) acquire it from consuming milk, water or feeds that are contaminated with faecal matter from an infected animal.\nThe sick animal portrays a voracious appetite and diarrhoea in a manner that the droppings are ejected out of its body in a projectile.\nThe faeces of the animals become watery and smelly as the animal grows thinner by the day before it finally dies.\nDue to the length of the period that the disease takes to show its clinical signs-two years- on the animal, Dr Omega says that most farmers are not able to recognise it or if they do, they treat something different.\nCONFUSE IT WITH WORMS\n\"Most farmers confuse it with worms, so they do not take necessary actions to arrest the undesirable side effects of the disease on other animals.\"\nDr Omega's concerns arise from a study that he conducted in Kericho where he was investigating the farmers' attitude and farm practices as far as the transmission of the disease is concerned.\nKericho recorded the first incidence of the disease in 1998 after the El Nino rains and the worst that the district experienced was in 2009, where 207 cases were recorded.\nDr Omega's research pointed out simple rules in farming, especially the milking techniques, which farmers violated out of ignorance that cost them money and their animals.\nCows graze in an field of pasture. Veterinary professionals are raising the red flag over the rise in Johne's disease, an incurable fatal ailment. PHOTO | BENJAMIN SITUMA | NATION MEDIA\nNine out ten of the 419 households that he interviewed (91.6 per cent) said that they let the calves suckle first before they milk and only a paltry 6 per cent fed their calves from the bucket.\n\"In the case that the udders of the cow are stained with faecal matter that tested positive for the disease, the calf stands a chance of being infected.\"\nApart from the danger of the disease, this method of feeding and milking disenfranchised the farmer in several ways.\n\"If the calf is used to feeding from the bucket, it can survive in case the mother dies, and when you have programmed the cow to produce milk only when the calf has suckled, it can never be milked without the calf should the calf die.\"\nDISPOSED THEIR LIVESTOCK MANURE\nSuch practices make farmers unable to account for the amount of milk that the calf takes.\n\"We asked them, how many litres the cow produces? They say 10 and when you ask them whether that is inclusive of what the calf suckled, they are at a loss of what to say,\" he said.\nDr Omega's research also revealed that almost all the famers in the area of study disposed their livestock manure in manner that increased the chances of the disease spreading to other animals.\nThe farmers \"leave it in the rubbish\", which leaves the waste with the pathogens exposed and contaminating the grass and can be washed away when it rains to another farmer's land where other animals become exposed.\nFor the choice of production systems, a whopping 98.4 per cent, practice mixed farming involving communal, zero or semi zero grazing.\nThe cleanliness of communal land, Dr Omega says, cannot be guaranteed and neither can be the health of the animals that access that land.\nInterestingly, when asked where their animals spend most of their time, 30 per cent of the Kericho farmers said \"in the communal land\".\nSENTIMENTAL VALUE\nThe motivations for keeping animals also shed light into the reason why the disease could not be kicked out of the small scale famers' herds.\nApart from being a source of income (96.4 per cent), source of food as in milk and eggs (96.4) or just being food like poultry (81.5 per cent), 26.8 farmers also said they keep the animals for sentimental values.\n\"These are those animals that were given to the household as a dowry, and the farmer becomes too attached to it that the animals cannot be removed from that system.\"\nIdeally, the sick animal is supposed to be culled-sold to the slaughterhouse- but, Dr Omega points out: \"You try to get the animal out of the farm and the farmer feels like it is the in-law being kicked out of the compound.\"\nNone of the farmers also attributed the cause of the diarrhoea to the infection.\nThey thought it was lush pasture, worms, an infection (but not Johnes). Most farmers treat animals based on personal experience, says Dr Omega.",

        "text": "The Division of Revenue Bill is the annual law passed by Parliament to divide money raised by the national government between national and county levels of government. This is a constitutional obligation under Article 218 of the Constitution.\nThe article provides that revenue raised nationally shall be shared equitably between the two levels of government. In any devolved jurisdiction, sharing of revenue between the central and the sub-national governments is based on specific criteria, entrenched either in the same Constitution or national legislation. In our case, the considerations that determine the equitable share are prescribed in Article 203 of the Constitution.\nThe Bill is now before Senate for debate. The Council of Governors has reviewed it and notes that serious constitutional issues have failed to be factored therein. Before the equitable share can be determined, the Constitution envisaged situations where specific projects of a national nature would be allocated funds before the division of revenue between the two levels took place.\nPursuant to Article 203(1)(a) of the Constitution, one of the first criteria that precedes allocating the equitable share is national interest. National interest, however, must not be construed to mean \"national government interests\".\nIn the Bill 2016, two of the items listed under national interest are essentially national government programmes - National Youth Service re-engineering and the laptops project.\nLegislators must be careful to differentiate between national interest and national government projects. The former should be based on priorities that contribute to the overall national goals which are not restricted to just one level of government. Matters related to security, economics and youth empowerment are examples that could be factored as national interest.\nActually, Bill 2016 describes what constitutes national interest as \"projects and programmes that potentially will have significant impact on the social well-being of citizens\". Premised on this then, youth polytechnics - which is a county government function - should be considered as part of national interest since these institutions contribute significantly to youth empowerment.\nNATIONAL INTEREST\nAdditionally, Early Childhood Education (ECDE), another county government function, should also be considered a matter of national interest owing to its pivotal role in childhood development.\nThe point is that county governments also implement projects of national interest. Therefore, Article 203(1)(a) of the Constitution must be determined within the context of Article 6 (2) of the Constitution, that is, consultatively between the two levels of government.\nThe revenue Bill has also itemised the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) under \"other national obligations\" provided for in Article 203(1)(b) of the Constitution. CDF is a national government fund which should be derived from the national government allocation after the equitable share has been divided.\nCDF is similar to Youth Fund, Women's Fund and other national government funds of commensurate nature. Again, it would be unconstitutional to construe national obligations to mean national government projects. The recently enacted National Government Constituency Development Fund Act cannot overrule the provisions of the Constitution.\nAnother component of the Bill that raises eyebrows is Emergencies (Contingencies and Strategic Grain Reserve), considered under Article 203 (1)(k) of the Constitution. There is a provision for Sh7.245 billion towards flexibility in responding to emergencies and other temporary needs.\nThis fund should be equally allocated to both levels of government since both levels respond to emergencies, and here we should consider the recent El Nino rains, cholera outbreaks and other circumstances which occur and may require adequate resources.\nFurther, the allocation for the Strategic Grain Reserve should also be considered a shared responsibility since agriculture is a devolved function.\nA close look at Bill 2016 reveals a very clever ploy by the National Assembly to deny counties their rightful share of the revenue.\nBill 2016 should be amended, failing which its provisions will be deemed to have gravely violated the Constitution.\nMr Peter Munya is Meru Governor and Chairman, Council of Governors",

        "text": "Thailand has long served as one of the globe's main rice bowls, but chronic water shortages are pushing the country to move away from a grain that dominates its fields and has defined a way of life for generations.\nLaddawan Kamsong has spent the past 40 years coaxing rice from her plot in central Thailand, but she is tired of watching her farmland squeezed dry by increasingly severe droughts.\n\"I plan to replace some rice paddies with limes,\" she told AFP after attending a government-run workshop urging farmers to diversify their crops.\nThailand is one of the world's top rice exporters.\nBut four consecutive years of below-average rainfall have drained water reserves and strangled production, pushing many farmers into debt.\nThe current drought, the worst the country has seen in decades, has hit nearly a third of Thailand's 76 provinces, particularly in the rice-heavy central and northeast. Reservoirs are also dropping to historically low levels. The kingdom's military government is now organising training sessions to encourage millions of rice farmers to diversify into crops that require less irrigation.\nCULTIVATING FRUIT TREES\nUnlike nearly all other crops, rice grows best in a flooded field, with the stalk's base completely submerged for most of the growing season.\nAt an army-run workshop held in patch of shade in a field in Nonthaburi province near Bangkok, Laddawan was sold the merits of cultivating fruit trees. In other regions, they are suggesting sugarcane or peas.\nThese alternatives will drastically reduce water consumption but also break the monoculture that has deteriorated Thai soil for decades.\n\"We have no choice, we need to adapt,\" Laddawan said, explaining that she used to plant three rice crops annually, but next year will only have enough water for one.\nAs the drought bites, some 2,000 Thai villages are surviving off water delivered by the government, while 'rainmaking' airplanes are flying over parched plains, sending an iodine solution into the air in an effort to seed clouds.\nAfter last year's especially weak rainy season - which falls between June and October - the ruling military junta asked farmers to abandon their winter rice crop, which is normally cultivated through irrigation and not rainfall.\n\"The amount of water in storage is low and now we expect that this year's rainy season will be delayed because of El Nino,\" said Suphot Tovichakchaikul, who leads the country's water management department.\nThe El Nino weather phenomenon tends to weaken the annual monsoon, which is a lifeline to farmers across the region.\nAccording to a study from the University of the Chamber of Commerce, the drought could shave between 0.5 and 0.8 per cent off Thailand's GDP growth, with its annual rice production predicted to drop almost 30 per cent to 25 million tonnes.",

The whole area looks like another place, I used to cross this river with a boat,\" he said.\nLand here should be producing maize, bananas, sesame and other fruits and vegetables, with the once broad waters of the river a lifeline for thousands of Somali families.\n'THIS IS A NIGHTMARE'\n\"All the villages in the regions rely on water from the river to survive, there are very few wells here and I don't think life is possible without the flow of water of the Shabelle River,\" said Mohamed Idle, an elder in Jowhar district, of the more than a 1,000 kilometre (800 mile) long river that begins in Ethiopia's highlands.\n\"This is a nightmare. I never thought of this river running dry, I can see the riverbed and children playing,\" said Abdulahi Mursal, another resident. \"People will soon start leaving here.\"\nFloods and failed rains caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon have sparked a dramatic rise in the number of people going hungry in large parts of Africa, including in arid regions of the Horn of Africa.\nNorthern Somali areas, including self-declared independent Somaliland along the Gulf of Aden and semi-autonomous Puntland, are especially hard hit, with some 385,000 people in dire need of food aid, according to the UN, with that figure feared to quadruple without help.\n\"Severe drought exacerbated by El Nino conditions has hit parts of Puntland and Somaliland, affecting hundreds of thousands of people,\" the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned in latest report.\n\"A further 1.3 million people risk slipping into acute food insecurity if they do not receive assistance... or nearly 40 percent of the 4.6 million people living in Puntland and Somaliland.\"\n'WE ARE DESPERATE'\nThe warning also comes as neighbouring Ethiopia - the source of the Shabelle river - struggles to combat its worst drought for 30 years, with at least 10.2 million people needing food aid.\nGetting aid to the people in Somalia is an enormous challenge, especially in southern districts, where the Al-Qaeda-linked Shabaab remain powerful, fighting government troops and a 22,000-strong African Union force.\nLast month, the UN warned over 58,000 children will starve to death in Somalia without urgent support.\nSevere drought and conflict in Somalia caused a famine in 2010-2012 that eventually killed a quarter of a million people. A similar number died during the previous 1992 famine.\nEl Nino is triggered by a warming in sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. It can cause unusually heavy rains in some parts of the world and drought elsewhere.\n\"The impact of the drought in the north is already being felt in southern and central regions,\" the UN said recently.\n\"There are concerns on the rapid deterioration of the water situation in Belet Weyne in Middle Shabelle region due to the rapid reduction of water levels.\"",

        "text": "Security, the Lamu Port Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor (Lapsset) project and land owner Evanson Waitiki are some of the major beneficiaries of the Supplementary Budget estimates MPs have been asked to approve.\nTreasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich on Monday listed the main cash recipients of the budget revisions for the current financial year, which he asked the Liaison Committee of the National Assembly to approve.\nThe security sector has already spent Sh7.6 billion more than it had initially been allocated, which Mr Rotich attributed to Operation Linda Boni, aimed at flushing out Al-Shabaab from Boni Forest in Lamu County.\nMr Waitiki, who gave up his 930 acres in Likoni, Mombasa County, for squatters will be a major beneficiary after selling his land.\n\"As you know, this had to be subdivided and the provision of funds is to allow for the release of titles and for subdivision of the Waitiki Farm. It is going to be incurred basically as soon as we get approval because already the owner has surrendered the title and he needs to be paid,\" said Mr Rotich.\nThe CS said with the President having presided over the release of the certificates of lease, the process is \"as good as done and all Parliament needs to do is release the funds for it\".\nMr Waitiki had initially asked the government for Sh10 million per acre, which would have come to Sh9.3 billion, but President Uhuru Kenyatta was reported to have offered Sh1.1 billion.\nWhen the land was handed over to the invaders, the government refused to state how much it had paid for it but Mombasa Woman Representative Mishi Mboko put the cost at Sh1.2 billion.\nPayment of the Sh1.3 billion will put an end to a long drawn-out stand-off between Mr Waitiki and the land invaders who, with the support of Coast politicians, had refused to leave the farm.\nLAPSSET PROJECT\nThe decision to allocate Sh1 billion to Lapsset was made in the wake of concerns that some key Vision 2030 projects had not been well funded.\n\"Lapsset continues to be a critical infrastructure even as we have discussions on the crude oil pipeline (with Uganda). If we were to use the northern route, obviously we'd need a port,\" said Mr Rotich, adding that the opening up of the northern corridor would also have a positive impact on security.\n\"This project is definitely still relevant. The Sh1 billion is a commitment that we still see this as a priority,\" Mr Rotich told the MPs.\nKenya's integration strategy is to provide infrastructure, such as the ongoing construction of the Standard Gauge Railway, to link countries in the region and beyond.\nHe said the project would also be allocated a substantial amount in the Budget for the next financial year, while at the same time considering other options.\nThe CS said some of the Sh42 billion the project was supposed to cost had already been spent and that Treasury had talks with the Transport and Infrastructure ministry on how to implement the project in three phases.\nIn the next phase, the project would get Sh20 billion for the construction of a berth at the port, the first of the three that are planned.\nMr Rotich said the government's finances were inadequate to pay for all development projects at the same time.\n\"We just have to prioritise. If actually we all agree and say let's slow down on energy and roads and then we go on with Lapsset, there would be no problem with that,\" said Mr Rotich.\nGOVERNMENT AIMS\nSome Sh10.9 billion will go into salaries, which Mr Rotich said would cater for the 10,000 policemen the government aims to have hired before next year's elections.\nThe war against corruption will get a Sh2.7-billion boost, the Higher Education Loans Board Sh1.5 billion, programmes to take care of the effects of El Nino Sh1.4 billion and the Anti-Doping Agency and preparations for the World Youth Championships Sh1 billion.\nKenya Airways will also benefit from a Sh20 billion loan the Government has taken from the African Export Import Bank.\nAn analysis of the estimates by the Parliamentary Budget Office shows that the Presidency will get an additional Sh1.2 billion and the Department of Infrastructure Sh11.6 billion.",

        "text": "The bailing of Mzee Jeremiah from the fake seeds scandal has made my work easier when it comes to the implementation of my manifesto, especially the digitisation of Mashambani Cooperative.\nIf you are not aware, milk production has hit an all-time high across the country, thanks to the El Nino rains. This means that the milk being produced by Mashambani Cooperative farmers cannot all be purchased by processors.\nOur milk ATM too cannot take more supply since the consumption of the milk is somewhat constant.\nI am now at crossroads because farmers cannot take a price cut. Besides, it is politically suicidal for me. I need a quick fix to safeguard my leadership before people start to criticise me - although Mzee Jeremiah is now silenced.\nI sought advice from my agri-political adviser - Adenya.\n\"Mkulima, let me sleep over it and I will revert,\" read his SMS. When I get such a message from him, I always know he has no idea of how to help because he rarely says he does not know.\nAngela was the next person I approached. It has been a long time since we had a discussion and this was the right time to talk to her.\n\"What would Magufuli do?\" Angela, a board member of the cooperative asked me jokingly when I narrated our problems.\n\"Reduce cost,\" I said after struggling with my guess.\n\"Good,\" she responded to my delight.\n\"Introduce austerity measures,\" she responded with her usual grammar not knowing most of the time I don't understand her big words despite my interest in having her consider me to be his life partner.\n\"So, what are those haus....hos...measures,\" I asked struggling with the new vocabulary.\n\"I will introduce you to a guy who is smart in this,\" Angela concluded as I got the feeling she is introducing me to a man smarter than me and may be his boyfriend.\nShe introduced me to Mike, whom I came to learn has trotted the globe in agricultural conferences.\nHe is an authority in cost-cutting having seemingly attained a PhD in the field. He once said he is beyond village problems when he was invited to solve some infrastructure issue at Mashambani Primary School.\nHaving expressed interest for a political seat, Mike is now ready to listen to the village problems and solve them. He has been visiting Mashambani regularly attending church services in different places in one Sunday.\nMike was quick to offer solution to my problem though his was a long hard scientific method.\n\"Mkulima, the cost of production will remain high unless the government introduces subsidies,\" Mike explained when he noted my serikali saidia based argument.\n\"Unless the county government buys milk and gives it to the local primary school children like they did during your time, there will be excess milk,\" he continued with his elite explanations.\n\"From what I am gathering, Mashambani has the highest operational cost when it comes to milk collection,\" Mike said with confidence indicating he knew what was ailing us.\n\"But I have solved that through digitisation of the weighing machine,\" I defended my previous cost-saving measures.\n\"That's good, but the transport cost remains one of your greatest expenditure especially with vehicle maintenance due to poor roads, Mike continued.\n\"With the average cost of producing 1kg of milk being Sh25, you need to at least pay farmers Sh35 or more to motivate them,\" Dr Mike explored.\n\"What scientific method did you use to come up with the current route of the lorries collecting milk?\" he asked.\n\"We gathered many scientific facts with my board members,\" I answered trying to sound like an intellectual.\n\"Mkulima, science is facts; just as houses are made of stones, so is science made of facts; but a pile of stones is not a house and a collection of facts is not necessarily science,\" Dr Mike said.\nHe mapped the milk processing factory, collection centres and road network at Mashambani village. He then created a topologically clean geometrical network dataset of the roads. From this, he was able to determine the most economical and efficient routes through the application of vehicle routing problem solution.\nHe then compared the current costs in terms of time and distance with those generated. It was shocking. We would save half the cost if we adopt his new route and number of lorries in collecting milk.\nNext week, I am announcing the new routes but before that, I will hold a small meeting with board members as this could open a new political battlefront with my critics.",

The expected late onset and poor temporal distribution of the seasonal rainfall is, however, likely to delay planting in most agricultural areas,\" said Mr Kongoti while releasing the country's March to May long rains forecast.\nPASTURES\nMr Kongoti said that the poor rainfall performance expected over the Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASALs) is likely to hurt the livestock sector adding that pastures for animals may not regenerate to optimum levels.\n\"In other agricultural counties like the Southeastern Kenya where the rainfall is expected to be generally depressed, farmers are also advised to liaise with the Ministry of Agriculture to get advise on the best use of rains by planting appropriate crops that are drought resistant,\" he said.\nMr Kongoti at the same time said rainfall over most parts of western, central and some northern counties (Moyale, Marsabit among other) is likely to be near-average while the Coastal strip is likely to experience slightly enhanced rainfall.\nMost of the eastern region of the country is likely to remain generally dry during the month of March. Much of the seasonal rainfall is likely to be recorded in April.\n\"The seasonal rainfall onset is expected during the second to third week of March over most parts of western Kenya.

These are the kinds of rates charged by shylocks.\nCommercial banks are supposed to partner with governments to improve the welfare of the citizens. In Kenya, banking is a cruel cartel that benefits from extortion of money, usually making more money than those they lend to.\nCOMPETITION AUTHORITY\nI blame the Competition Authority of Kenya for sleeping on the job.\nThis body is supposed to have investigated banks and come up with findings to ensure that there is justice for all.\nAlternatively, it should have been that banks would be paying corporate tax at 75 per cent of net profits if the regulatory bodies have thrown up their hands in defeat.\nKenya Power (KP) is another entity slowing down the GDP growth of Kenya considerably.\nReports emanating from KenGen indicate that KP has been supplied with cheap electricity for distribution but the company is still billing everybody at rates used during the Kanu era.\nThe reason for this is the contracts entered into with Kanu-era independent power producers (IPP), who use diesel to generate power.\nNeither the collapse of international oil prices nor the increase in dam levels from El Nino rains has made any difference.\nAdditionally, even with more power generation from Ol Karia, the national power utility company allowed two more diesel generators to enter the crowded mix.\nKenya's growth shall remain stunted because of predatory interest rates and unmanageable power costs.\nNo meaningful industrial growth can take place when corrupt ruling-elite cartels are allowed to raid our pockets at their whim.\nOur products cannot effectively compete with cheaper ones from Egypt, South Africa, and China and unemployment of the youth will remain a reality.\nIf this government cared about the Vision 2030 mark, the Competition Authority of Kenya would have sorted out these issues a long time ago.\nKARIUKI MUIRI, Karatina",

No one knows whether the companies the hawkers purport to represent actual exist or a sham.\" The Pharmacy and Poisons Board, he urges, should urgently take up the matter with the seriousness it deserves to curb the danger.

        "text": "Tens of millions of people in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean are likely to face starvation in the first six months of this year as the El Nino cycle reaches its peak and makes its full impact felt.\nHumanitarian agencies have warned of a major food crisis in 2016 if action is not taken to prevent this impending calamity, as well as water shortages and disease outbreaks.\nMost of East Africa is already stressed in terms of food security, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fewsnet).\nParts of Ethiopia, South Sudan, Somalia and Sudan are already in the crisis and emergency stages on the hunger scale, with millions of people needing food assistance.\nFewsnet has also reported that Ethiopia is the most affected country, with a serious risk of famine.\nThe country is currently experiencing the worst drought in more than 50 years, which is expected to put at least 15 million people in desperate need of food aid in the first half of this year.\nAlready, aid agencies have issued a food security emergency alert, with areas most affected listed as Southern Afar and Northern Somali, which are already in the emergency stage on the hunger scale (IPC Phase 4).\n\"It's already too late for some regions to avoid a major emergency,\" says aid agency Oxfam. \"It will cost at least $1.4 billion (Sh143 billion) to respond to the emergency in Ethiopia.\"\nThe drought has been worsened by the super El Nino that is sweeping across the world. Oxfam says it intends to reach at least 777,000 people to provide them with water, sanitation and food aid.\n\"Millions of people in places like Ethiopia, Haiti and Papua New Guinea are already feeling the effects of drought and crop failure.\n\"We urgently need to get help to these areas to make sure people have enough food and water,\" said Jane Cocking, Oxfam's humanitarian director.\n\"Ethiopia is a disaster in the making. The longer it takes for humanitarian assistance to reach the people in need, the greater the impact of the drought becomes,\" said Geir Olav Lisle, the deputy secretary-general at the Norwegian Refugee Council.\nOther countries of great concern are South Sudan and Yemen, both of which are affected by conflict.\nNigeria, Chad, Central Africa Republic, Haiti, Central America and the Southern Africa region are also on the hunger watch list.\nIn Sudan, the Blue Nile region and South Kordofan state are the most affected, with the food security situation said to be deteriorating.\nHarvests are projected to be very low, worsened by the ongoing El Nino.\nFood insecurity is expected to worsen later in the year.\nAnd then there's Southern Africa.\nFOOD SHORTAGES\nThe region is expected to begin experiencing food shortages as early as February, and South Africa has already declared several provinces disaster areas due to the El Nino drought.\n\"Aid agencies are already stretched responding to the crises in Syria, South Sudan and Yemen. We cannot afford other large-scale emergencies developing elsewhere. If the world waits to respond to emerging crises in southern Africa and Latin America, we will not be able to cope,\" says Oxfam.\nThe drought in South Africa is the worst since 1982, with at least 2.7 million people facing food and water shortages.\nThe lack of rain occasioned high temperatures in many parts of South Africa.\nJohannesburg and Pretoria, for instance, recorded their highest temperatures ever, with 36C and 39.8C respectively. Johannesburg has even started rationing water, with some reports saying that shower times have been limited to just three minutes to save water.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has already issued an alert for Southern Africa, saying that the reduced harvests will greatly affect food security.\nThe region's small-scale farmers are almost entirely dependent on rain, making their harvests highly susceptible to its variations.\nIMPACT OF EL NINO\nWhile El Nino's impact depends highly on location and season - the impact of El Nino on agricultural production appears more muted in the northern areas - strong episodes have been associated with reduced production in several countries, including South Africa, which is the largest cereal producer in the sub-region and typically exports maize to the neighbouring countries.\nSouth Africa has already declared drought in five provinces, its main cereal-producing regions, while Lesotho has issued a drought mitigation plan and Swaziland has implemented water restrictions since reservoir levels have shrunk.\nFarmers are the worst hit by the drought. Lack of rain leads to crop failure, meaning no income for them.\nSome large-scale farmers have cut down on staff to reduce costs.\nFood prices are already rising, and are expected to rise further in the first few months of the year, mostly because they will be imported.\nReports from South Africa say that the cost of maize meal has risen by 14 per cent, and the cost of bread by 7 per cent.\nEggs and chicken are up 15 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. FAO reports that the increase in the price of maize has already hit 50 per cent.\nMAIZE\nMaize is the staple crop in South Africa and the drought has cost the maize industry a total of R12 billion (Sh72 billion) in lost revenue. The sugar industry has lost R2 billion (Sh12 billion).\nIn Malawi, the national food security forecast for 2016 estimates that 2.9 million people will need emergency food aid before March.\nFewsnet says that up to 2.8 million people are likely to face acute food shortage in Malawi alone.\nMeanwhile, Zimbabwe will record significantly lower maize harvests, straining food security.\nOther countries affected by the El Nino drought in Southern Africa are Botswana, Zambia, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique.\nThe United Nations Children's Fund estimates that at least 11 million children will face starvation as a result.\nBut whether an El Nino brings heavy rainfall or not depends on where you are in relation to the equator.\nKenya, Somalia, Uganda, Congo and Gabon are among the 13 countries around the world that straddle the Equator, meaning that El Nino will almost always bring rain in these countries, but the intensity will vary, depending on the strength of the El Nino.\n\"The countries that fall off the equator often experience dry spells, with worse droughts further from the equator. This is why Southern Africa and Australia are experiencing a really bad drought,\" says Mr Simon Muhindi of FAO.\nThe El Nino's effects, whether drought or floods, are expected to seriously strain food security and humanitarian systems across the world.\nVARIED IMPACT\nHistorically, the impact of El Nino on East Africa has been varied, ranging from floods - which affected 3.4 million people in 2006/2007 - to droughts, which affected 14 million people in 2009/2010.\nWhile there are sub-regional differences, historical comparisons show that overall humanitarian needs in the region are higher in El Nino years than non-El Nino years.\nIn the 2015/2016 El Nino cycle, at least 300,000 people have been displaced by flooding across the region, and more than 100 people have died in floods in Kenya.\nA further two million people remain at risk of more flooding in East Africa.\nAccording to an Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) report, the numbers of those who are food-insecure rose by 64 per cent, from 11.3 million in August to 18.5 million in December 2015.\nThese, according to Igad, require urgent food assistance.\nWhile the Ethiopian government already has the $1.4 billion (Sh143 billion) it needs to avert a famine in the country, Kenya and Somalia both need $15 million (Sh105 billion) and $30 million (Sh210 billion) respectively, which they don't have.\n\"This humanitarian crisis in Eastern Africa is threatening the regional development and resilience gains as it comes against the backdrop of a wider humanitarian crisis; the geographic confluence of sustained conflict levels - localised economic shocks, particularly in South Sudan, continue to exacerbate humanitarian needs,\" said Igad Executive Secretary Mehboub Maalim.\nThe UN says the number of people who have been forced to flee their homes because of conflict has hit 60 million, a level previously unknown in the post-World War II era.\nThe UK's Department for International Development said it had pledged to provide emergency support for 2.6 million people and 120,000 children beginning this month.\n\"If we fail to act now against this especially powerful El Nino, we will fail vulnerable people across our world,\" Development Minister Nick Hurd said in a statement.\n\"Ensuring security for those affected by El Nino is important to their countries but also in Britain's national interest.\n\"Only by protecting and stabilising vulnerable countries can we ensure people are not forced to leave their homes in search of food or a new livelihood,\" he added.\nEl Ninos are often followed by La Nina cycles, which can have the opposite but similarly harmful effects.\nCountries currently experiencing severe drought from El Nino are likely to experience flooding in 2016 as a result of La Nina.\nFAO warns that there is an increased risk of a Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in East Africa this year following the El Nino floods.\nThe floods create habitats for mosquitoes, which spread RVF, a disease that affects livestock.",

        "text": "A group of women spur their donkeys on as they hurry along the Njoro-Nessuit road. The donkeys are carrying stacks of firewood, which the women have just harvested from the Mau Forest.\nRemarkably, until the 1990s, the road in the Mau Forest was no more than a narrow path choked with dense undergrowth, as well as ferns and trees, through which one had to painstakingly thread their way to enter the Forest.\nBut uncontrolled harvesting of trees in the forest for firewood and charcoal has had serious consequences.\nKaria Lembule, whose Ogiek people rely heavily on the forest, says the destruction began in 1995. Born in 1944 into the Tiriatab Suswe clan, Lembule says the destruction has forced the local people to change their diet. The hunter-gatherer community, which once survived on honey, wild fruits and meat, has now been forced to take up farming. This, he argues, is tantamount to colonising their eating habits.\nThe massive harvesting of indigenous plants resulted in the extinction of certain trees and shrubs that attracted bees to the Ogiek's traditional beehives. Lembule says he was once the proud owner of 200 beehives, harvesting honey in January, April and August since there was adequate rainfall throughout the year, which ensured that there were enough of the plants the bees fed on.\nHis gesunguti (honey store), now a mere relic, was always filled with the cherished food, which, he says, kept diseases at bay and also served as an anti-ageing agent.\nNotably, some varieties of the indigenous trees that thrived on the banks of the streams and rivers in the forest, forming a heavy canopy, were logged to extinction.\n\"You cannot find those trees anymore, and that is why few people have beehives. Many of us have only two or three beehives, but even then it is just a matter of trial-and-error because you wait for the bees but they won'e come,\" says Lembule, who lives in Kiptunga, a sub-station of the Mau Forest Complex.\nThe situation was further aggravated when parts of the forest were converted into human settlements, as well as into farmland and pasture. The human activity that followed led to the drying up of springs flowing from the source of all springs in the Rift Valley and western parts of the country.\n\"We had rivers Iterit, Mbaragia and Tiribati Susuweki, which are yet to be restored,\" Lembule says. \"They fed River Ndarugu, which flows into River Njoro. These rivers supported the vegetation that favoured beekeeping, which are now extinct.\"\nLife has certainly changed for the more than 10,000 Ogieks living in the Eastern Mau, which comprises --Kiptunga, Logoman, Terret and Likia forests.\nThe change in rainfall patterns and loss of the special vegetation has cost them not just a source of livelihood, but also their health, Lembule avers.\n\"We never used to go to hospital. When someone fell sick, they would be given concoctions made from herbs and honey. But today our children have to be taken to hospital even for simple illnesses such as fever,\" he explains.\n\"Look at me now,\" says the weary looking Lembule, \"my skin is rough and my bones are all rattly. This would not have been the case had I been eating honey. Our bodies are not used to potatoes or foods like maize. Honey is our life.\"\nShifting to crop and livestock farming has not been easy for the community.\nFAR-REACHING EFFECTS\n\"The rains were part of our lives and bees thrived. There was a lot of rain from January to October, and it subsided only in November and December. Today, we are forced to grow potatoes and maize, but we always worry about the harvests since the rains are so unpredictable. Besides, this is not the life we are used to,\" Lembule adds.\nLembule only wishes they could restore the rivers that gave life to the plants that provided food for bees.\n\"If people had not burnt down trees, perhaps we would still be having some. They loved water and hated hot sun,\" he says wistfullly. Karia.\nThe effects of the degradation of the largest montane forest in East Africa have been felt, not just by the neighbouring community and Kenya as a whole, but much further afield as well. This is because it boasts the largest groundwater reservoir upon which the 12 rivers feeding the major national and trans border lakes stream from, according to the Kenya Forest Service.\nAmong these are rivers Njoro, Makalia, Mara and Nderit, which drain into Lake Victoria, which is shared by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.\nThe lakes around which tourism is built such as lakes Nakuru, Elementaita, Baringo and Bogoria, which also benefit from the water tower, have also suffered the impact of its destruction.\n\"These rivers had nearly dried up by the time rehabilitation efforts began in 2008,\" says Cosmas Ikiugu, who is heading the efforts to restore the Mau Forest.\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) says that between 1990 and 2001, up to 107,000 hectares of the Mau Forest Complex's more than 400,000 hectares were destroyed.\nThe destruction resulted in the drying up of River Mara, which supports the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, as well as the River Miriu, whose waters are now being used to generate power.\nOther activities such as agriculture and water supply were also adversely affected.\nMeanwhile, Unep and KFS estimate that six million people in East African benefit directly from the Mau Forest Complex since it's the largest water tower in the region, supporting a variety of economic activities.\nThe forest's degradation also led to erratic weather patterns and flash floods, which are most severe in Narok. Trees serve as carbon sinks, so when they are destroyed, more carbon is left in the atmosphere, which warms the environment, leading to alternate seasons' of floods and droughts.\nBut, unless the local people understand that they are a contributing factor, little will be achieved in the fight to reverse the negative effects, conservationists say.\nThe greatest destruction took place on the eastern and western sections, where close to 150,000 people had settled illegally, resulting in massive degradation of the forest's ecosystem, Ikiugu says.\nThese cases were witnessed in Nakuru County in the eastern zone, and Narok County in the western zone.\nThe Mau Forest Complex spreads across five counties, namely Nakuru, Kericho, Baringo, Narok and Bomet.\n\"There are climatic changes associated with the destruction of the water tower. In fact, that is why we are have discussions on the El Nino rains and dry spells in the country,\" says Ikiugu.\nThe heavy floods Narok experiences, siltation of rivers and soil erosion in certain parts of Njoro, Kuresoi and Molo are just some of the effects of the degradation the water tower, according to conservationists.\nIn 2008, when the destruction of the forest was at its peak, driving four kilometres into Lake Nakuru National Park was easy thanks to the greatly receded water levels, an indication of the detrimental effects of the degradation of Mau Forest, Ikiugu says.\nThe receding of Lake Nakuru's waters negatively affected the more than 500 animal and bird species because it changed the ecosystem. Similarly affected was the River Mara.\n\"I remember in around 2002, the water levels in the River Mara were so low that there was little excitement about wildebeest migration,\" notes Ikiugu.\nIt is around this period that blackouts and rationing of electricity took a heavy toll on manufacturing industries, which consume 65 per cent of the power in the country.\nThe hydro power generating River Miriu, which is fed by springs from the Mau Forest, had dwindled to a trickle, the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) officer accounts.\nNakuru County director for the environment, energy and natural resources, Timothy Kiogora concurs, saying, \"Forests are reservoirs that absorb carbon so when we destroy them, we really cannot expect anything apart from climatic changes.\n\"This occurs as a result of increasing the greenhouse gases that warm up the atmosphere. And the result is floods, droughts, erratic rainfall patterns and even an increase in diseases.\"\nHaving had first-hand experience, Kiogora still recalls with horror how he more than Sh1 million after a wheat crop he planted in Nessuit in 2007 failed.\nIn 2005, he had planted potatoes on 20 acres in the same region and the harvests were impressive, thanks to the favorable weather conditions at the time. The next two seasons he had equally good harvests.\nEncouraged, he decided to diversify and expanded the acreage to 30, using the additional land to grow wheat.\n\"I planted in March but, interestingly, it did not rain in April as I had expected. It was hot until August. Pests infested the crop and all the wheat withered. I harvested nothing,\" says the environment specialist, an alumnus of Egerton University, who would go to the Mau Forest to buy honey for Sh5 a litre in the mid-1990s.\n\"In 1990, the forest began at Ngata (about five kilometres from the Nakuru central business district and you could hear the waters of the River Njoro gushing. Today, it is a different story,\" he notes.\nBut even as people like Lembule yearn for a long-gone past following the loss of their main source of his livelihood things are beginning to look up.\nDiscussions on the rehabilitation of the Mau Forest Complex featured prominently during the launch of the United Nations initiative on Reducing Emissions from Forest Degradation and Deforestation(UN-REDD) in September 2009, a year after then Prime Minister Raila Odinga embarked on a drive to restore the water tower.\nMore than 20,000 families - mainly Ogieks - were evicted from the forest, but some still live in Kiptunga Forest, and others on its fringes namely Nessuit, Mariashoni, Likia, Lari and Terret.\nThe initiative, a collaboration between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Development Programme involves reducing greenhouse gases which, globally, account for 17 per cent of the total global warming gases.\nMeanhwile, efforts to counter the effects of the devastation of the montane forest are slowly bearing fruit; a number of stakeholders have made commitments aimed at restoring the country's largest water tower.\nIn fact, some improvements have already been made.\nWhat has been achieved\nSo far 70,000 hectares have been rehabilitated through the Kenya Forestry Service's (KFS) collaboration with the adjacent communities, non-state actors, development partners and agencies, including the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Development Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organisation, says Cosmas Ikiugu, the head of the Mau Conservancy.\nThe Plantation Establishment for Livelihoods Scheme (PELIS), a collaborative programme between KFS and neighbouring communities, is giving the Mau afforestation momentum.\nMore than 100 community forest associations (CFAs), - communities organised into groups to access forest land where trees have been harvested - are allowed to grow crops in the forested land for three years while they take care of the trees. This has yielded encouraging results, Ikiugu says.\n\"Now we have Lake Nakuru overflowing and the River Mara is full,\" he adds. The rehabilitation programme has also attracted funding from the Dutch government.\nThe Nakuru County director for the environment, Timothy Kiogora, says the funds can be used on initiatives aimed at sensitising the communities to the importance of protecting the Mau ecosystem and enlightening them on alternative sources of livelihoods.\nThe three-year funding project expected to extend to 2018 targets communities in Nakuru, Narok and Bomet counties in the eastern Mau zone.\n\"It is not enough to tell people to conserve the forest, especially when they depend on it for firewood, or timber, or bee keeping. You must give them an alternative,\" says Kiogora.\nSustainable use of local natural resources is among the 17 post-2015 agenda that countries will be striving to achieve.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals, to which Kenya is a signatory as a member of the United Nations, emphasise the need to embrace collaborative methods in efforts to alleviate poverty and manage resources efficiently.",

We need to preserve the future of these crops for the sake of the country and farmers,\" the association's chairman said.\nSpeaking during a consultative meeting with grain growers in an Eldoret Town hotel on Wednesday, Mr Kruger said despite wheat being the second most important cereal crop after maize in Kenya, authorities in general and the ministry of agriculture in particular were not doing enough to support its production.\nSELL 350,000 BAGS\nHe said farmers in Narok and Uasin Gishu counties were still unable to sell more than 350,000 bags of wheat.\nMr Kruger added that this was making farmers reduce acreage on wheat while others were selling portions of their land to service loans.\n\"Drastic measures must be taken to save the Kenyan farmer. Foreigners are being enriched at the expense of local producers,\" Mr Robert Kaptich from Kesses in Uasin Gishu said.\nMr Kruger, who is also a maize and wheat grower in Moiben said local farmers have had to compete unfairly against imported grain mostly from Europe, South America and parts of Asia.\n\"Farmers in these countries often enjoy huge subsidies from their governments as well as superior infrastructural support. Despite the production constraints, local farmers continue to produce wheat that is of better quality than the imported grain,\" he added.\nMASSIVE LOSSES\nThe farmers' problems have been aggravated by the El Nino rains which pounded the country in the last three months.\nThe rains also affected the quality of wheat, leading to massive losses.\n\"Most farmers only managed to harvest about 50 per cent of their anticipated produce. The high cost of production made matters worse,\" the association's Chief Executive Officer Anthony Kioko said.\nAccording to the farmers, prices of locally produced wheat have dropped to about Sh2,500 per 90kg bag.\nThey say this is far below the unit cost of production.\nThe farmers add that a bag needs to be sold for between Sh2,800 and Sh3,200.\n\"The low prices have discouraged farmers who are threatening to abandon wheat growing. If the government does not address the matter, it would lead to food insecurity. Livelihoods will also be seriously threatened,\" Mr Kioko said.\nThe association, which has a membership of 30,000, is proposing that the government revises the import duty to 35 per cent in order to stabilise the market for the wheat sub-sector.",

In fact, 300,000 people have been displaced in the entire eastern Africa region and not Kenya alone.\nThe story also inaccurately reported that Kenya government had not adequately responded to the El Nino rains. The errors have since been corrected.",

It pays to take such things with a pinch of salt.\" His contact is [email protected]\n***\nDANGEROUS POTHOLES: Of the roads in Nairobi's Industrial Area that are crying out for repairs, Martin Irungu singles out Kampala and Kitui roads, which have deep crater-like potholes.\nWith the El Nino rains pounding the city, Martin warns, motorists risk smashing into the holes and badly damaging their vehicles. However, he swears that the same potholes were patched up only four months ago, but are now worse than before.\nThe city county government and the Kenya Urban Roads Authority, he pleads, should investigate. His contact is [email protected]\n***\nBAD ROAD: The Kitui-Kibwezi road, Mwanzia Kyambia, an engineer charges, is the \"only untarmacked Class B road\" in the country. The ongoing rains, he adds, have made the road, which falls under the jurisdiction of the National Government, almost impassable.\nA distance that should take just about one-and-a-half hours, he states, now takes a whole eight hours to cover.\n\"Politicians have always campaigned, promising to have this road upgraded, but on being voted in, it just remains the same.

        "text": "After buying tractors to bring more land under cultivation and distributing seeds and fertiliser to poor families, Machakos County has now turned to green grams. Governor Alfred Mutua spoke to JULIUS SIGEI.\nIn our last interview two years ago, you told us that only about 20 per cent of the arable land in Machakos was under agriculture and that you planned to increase this to 70 per cent. What is the situation now?\nWe have been able to plough extensively. We are looking at about 4,000 hectares. We have increased the amount of food being grown because of our initiative of distributing free seeds and fertiliser to poor families.\nWe also have 40 tractors ploughing for free. Our priority now is on green grams. We have secured a huge market in India and we are now testing different varieties on different soils. We chose this crop because it needs only two weeks of rain to do well. We have set aside 10,000ha for this.\nYou also spoke of the Kienyeji chicken project. How is that now?\nThe chicken programme is going on. We now have our own hatcheries. We should be able to do a million chicks beginning in the New Year.\nWe want every home to have a minimum of 30 chickens. To me hunger is not about lack of food, but lack of money to buy food. When you are hungry and you have chickens, you sell two cocks and buy flour, bread and milk.\nWe have held a meeting with all Non-Governmental Organisations to assist us in food security. By the end of 2017, there won't be food relief in Machakos.\nLook at Saudi Arabia which is really a desert. They don't grow food, yet there is no hunger there. They have money that allows them to buy food.\nMango juice made in Masaku. How far is this juice?\nThe challenge has been getting the appropriate land for the factory land. We now have a suitable site at Masii. Engineers are on the ground and the design has been done.\nWe shall be breaking the ground in February. By the beginning of 2017 we shall be shipping out our first juice. We are also partnering with USAID and other NGOs on mango drying to make snacks such as chips.\nThe goodness with mangoes is that nothing is thrown away. We shall export mango chips. Such bitings are also popular with airlines. We are also reviving grapes, especially in Lukenya and Yatta areas. They do very well in Ukambani. This will create jobs in the wine industry.\nWhen it rains in Machakos it pours. And this was indeed your phrase two years ago. It must ring truer more so now during this El Nino times. How are you utilising this water to bring money into farmers' pockets?\nWe have constructed more than 200 mini dams. We want to take this number to 500 by the end of next year. We are also doing river dams and digging boreholes.\nWe shall have 600 boreholes by the end of June. All this will cost Sh3 billion, but we will do it because it will support our agricultural and industrial endeavours. They will take care of the chickens and kitchen gardens in every home.\nLack of extension has been the bane of farmers in this country. How are the Machakos farmers faring on this front?\nWe are on course with our extension services. We have extension officers in every ward and they are helping with vaccination and treatment of our animals.\nThey have motor cycles to help them reach every nook and cranny of the county. Extension is even going to be more critical as we embark on the green grams project.",

As you can see, all these were empty promises.\"\nMr Odinga also criticised the ruling coalition for failing to curb corruption in most government institutions.\n\"All I can say is that in two weeks' time Kenyans will get to know the intrigues behind the Eurobond saga,\" said Odinga amid cheers from the crowd.\nHe also called upon the Jubilee administration to step up the war on graft by arresting and prosecuting all those facing corruption allegations.\n\"We can all see that the government has increased taxation rates for even small commodities a clear indication that the government is running bankrupt since they have debts all over. We want all suspects of corruption put behind bars,\" the Cord leader added.\nHe was accompanied by Silvance Osele Onyango (MP Kabondo Kasipul) and David Songok (ODM, Uasin Gishu County chairperson) among others.\nMILK FARMERS\nEarlier in the day, Mr Odinga challenged the government to revert the once famous Kenya Co-operative Creameries back to farmers.\nHe said that the former regime temporally repossessed KCC from the hands of corrupt individuals and it was to be returned to farmers.\n\"Till today, KCC is still under the government. We are saying no to this and we will not allow this to happen as Opposition,\" he said.\nHe said that farmers are suffering because of poor policies, bad management and corruption.\nHe urged that the government to borrow a leaf from developed countries on how modern agriculture is managed and empower the farmers.\nMr Odinga said that the Okoa Kenya initiative seeks to among other things, devolve the land function to counties since Ardhi House has turned into a den of corruption and land cartels.\nHe urged Kenyans to support the referendum for the sake of the country.\nPLAYING MIND GAMES\nElsewhere, Senate Majority leader Moses Wetang'ula has poked holes into President Uhuru Kenyatta's commitment to fight graft saying he is merely blinding Kenyans by engaging in a piecemeal approach.\nReferring to the Eurobond, Mr Wetang'ula said the government has mastered the art of creating diversionary tactics by playing mind games with Kenyans under the guise of combating corruption.\nThe Bungoma senator said the graft allegations levelled against him are part of the scheme to shift the attention of Kenyans from the true state of corruption in government institutions.\n\"We want the government to furnish Kenyans with answers on mega scandals including the Eurobond, Galana irrigation project, El Nino funds and the Laptop project,\" he told mourners during a burial ceremony in Trans Nzoia.\nKiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said corruption within the government will slow the country's economic growth rate and poured cold water on efforts by the government to fight the vice.\n\"Kenyans have lost confidence in the Jubilee coalition going by recent opinion polls. We challenge the government to tackle the graft menace without sparing some sectors,\" said Mr Wamalwa.\nTrans Nzoia Senator Henry ole Ndiema called on the special committee formed by the Independent Boundaries Commission (IEBC) on the de-registration of Senator Wetang'ula to ensure justice is served.\n\"We are challenging the IEBC to ensure that the committee to investigate the senator desists from being compromised to suit \"somebody's interest,\" said Mr Ndiema.\nAn MP also faulted some Luhya leaders for working closely with some Jubilee operatives to curtail Mr Wetang'ula's political career.\n\"We know that there are a section of leaders from this community who are behind Mr Wetang'ula's woes with a hope of curtailing his rising political star,\" said Likuyani MP Enoch Kibunguchy while warning them against the machinations.",

        "text": "Residents of some city estates are worried over broken sewer lines and unchecked dumping in rivers.\nThe sight of raw sewerage has become common with sewer lines leaking as a result of heavy rains which experts are attributing to the El Nino weather phenomenon.\nIt is not unusual for sewer lines in Nairobi to break down during heavy rains.\nAnd the raw sewer usually flows into rivers making lives of many City residents unbearable.\nMany people have expressed their appreciation of efforts by City Hall to unclog the drainage system.\nThe City County government has deployed hundreds of youths in areas mapped out as flooding hotspots to clear waterways and other channels.\nIt has also stationed engineers in the areas who are assisting people to deal with the flood waters.\nSHOWS NO SERIOUSNESS\nConcern has also been raised over the pollution of the Nairobi River basin.\nThe river is fed by several parallel streams flowing towards the eastern side of Nairobi.\nThese rivers that form the basin meet at the River Athi and eventually flow into the Indian Ocean.\nThese rivers collect all kinds of dirt especially the effluent dumped by people living in the slums of Kibera, Mathare, Kawangware and Mukuru Kwa Njenga.\nThis is what has been poisoning and littering the Nairobi River basin.\nPollution in the basin is not new but this time, the situation has been made worse by the on-going rains as the National Environmental Management Authority (Nema) also admits.\n\"It is true that people have been complaining to us about pollution of rivers due to dumping and raw sewage, which is being discharged into rivers,\" Nema Nairobi County Director, Titus Simiyu, confirmed saying his office has been receiving numerous complaints from people.\nUPMARKET RESIDENTS WORST HIT\nSome of the people worst affected by the pollution are residents of upper market estates of Lavington and Kileleshwa whose residential houses neighbour Kirichwa Dogo River.\nThe river that passes through the two estates from Kawangware has always been prone to dumping by the slum dwellers.\nAccording to Mr Simiyu, there are no sewer lines in Kawagware.\nThere are people who use pit latrines while there others who do not have toilets.\nLike in the sprawling Kibera slums where toilets also do not exists, some slum dwellers use what is referred to as \"flying toilets\".\nA flying toilet is a plastic bags for open defecation, which, after use is thrown away.\nIn Kawangware, when these bags are thrown on a channel, they are swept by flood waters into Kirichwa Dogo River.\nA spot check by Nation in this slum revealed that most of these plastic bags are usually collected by a group of youth employed by waste management companies.\nThey collect the bags together with others containing ordinary wastes and put them in a dumping site for collection by trucks, which then dispose garbage at the Dandora dumpsite.\nACCESS ROADS IMPASSABLE\n\"During the rains, access roads in the slums are impassable by mkokoteni (pull cart) and so most of the garbage goes uncollected,\" one of the youth said on condition of anonymity.\nIn Kibera, Mr Simiyu said human waste and other garbage is swept into Mutu-ini-Ngong River.\nThese mucky waters sometimes spill over into residential estates during rainy seasons when the river banks bursts.\nThe Nairobi County Nema director said another problem has been uncollected garbage dumped near river banks.\nHe said they have been trying to engage both the City County government and Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company over the issue of uncollected garbage and breakages of sewer lines.\n\"None of them have been accepting to take the responsibility,\" he said.\nSewer lines are seeping in several other parts of the City affecting livelihoods of many including traders.\nCity Hall had in this year's budget set aside Sh119 million, part of which was for cleaning up the Nairobi River besides improving sewer lines in Dandora and Kayole estates.\nWhat is not clear is whether the regional government has since come up with any defined project for cleaning the river.\nCHOLERA OUTBREAKS\nThe national government was early this month forced to intervene given that pollution of the Nairobi River basin is always blamed cholera outbreaks in the City.\nThis is what compelled Environment, Natural Resources and Regional Development Authorities Cabinet Secretary, Judy Wakhungu to convene a meeting of different players in government early November to address the issue of pollution in the Nairobi River basin whose contamination is becoming a threat to City residents.\nProf Wakhungu immediately formed a joint task-force comprising of different government agencies that would be seeking for the temporary solution to this pollution.\nThe task-force whose mandate is to first seek for a temporary solution is being coordinated by Urban River, a newly created department in the ministry.\nMembers of the-task force include Nema, City County of Nairobi and Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Services (NCWSS).\nOthers are Water Resource Management Authority (Warma) and Athi Water Services Board (AWSB).\nWarma is a state corporation, which is a lead agency in water resources management while AWSB is responsible for provision of efficient and economical water and sanitation services within the city of Nairobi and its outlying areas.\nUPGRADE SEWER SYSTEM\n\"We are trying to see if we could raise money to first upgrade the sewer system, which cannot cope with the increasing population,\" Urban River director, Eric Akotsi told Nation in a telephone interview.\nThe task force has already prepared a budget, which Mr Akotsi did not disclose.\nThe budget will be presented to the Cabinet for approval.\nMr Akotsi said they also want to include Land, Housing and Urban Development ministry to assist in marking riparian boundaries in Nairobi.\n\"The presence of people living on riparian land is another cause of pollution of the rivers and we have to get a way of addressing this problem,\" the Urban River director said.\nA similar project to clean the Nairobi River basin had successfully been started by the late John Michuki in 2008 when he was the Environment Minister.\nThe initiative had worked but it later collapsed with the demise of the former Kangema MP in 2011.",

For the last two weeks, we have experienced a worse nightmare because we keep watching for the rains lest we are swept away,\" Ms Kerubo said.\nShe spoke as the Kenya Red Cross confirmed that the situation was dire and hinted of possible a meeting with the County Government on Friday to discuss a humanitarian intervention.\nMr Juma Isaac, a County Red Cross official coordinating the agency's response team in the affected area said they expect the County Government's assistance to ensure the affected families are assisted.\nThe residents said most of their property including documents, food and clothing have been destroyed by the rain water that flood their houses.\nThe affected residents blamed the County government for failing to come up with a quick response mechanism despite the area being identified as one of the hotspots prone to flooding whenever it rains.\n\"We need a breakdown of how Sh500 million meant for El Nino preparedness is being spent by the County government. We are suffering here yet we have not received any communication from the County government for the last two weeks.\" another resident, Mr Samuel Momanyi, said.\nEarly October, Governor Kinuthia Mbugua unveiled the El Nino preparedness steering committee to implement a comprehensive plan and announced that the County would use Sh500 million to mitigate the effects.\nHowever, the residents said they are yet to receive any communication or help from the preparedness team from the County government.\n\"These families should be evacuated to safer grounds as soon as possible. The children here are staying hungry and have nowhere to spend their nights,\" a former area councillor Mr Joel Nyandieka said.\n\"There are no proper drainage systems in the area which is the main reason why people are being displaced.

        "text": "The slopes of Taita Hills in Werugha currently host French peas, cabbages, baby marrows (courgettes) and spinach as farmers seek to make hay while the sun shines during this El Nino rains period.\nOur destination is Wanyumba Farm, where Amon Mghendi breeds Irish potatoes on the five acres.\nMghendi was trained as a small-scale Irish potato seed bulking farmer in 2009 by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (Kalro), and since then, he had bred hundreds of seeds of the Asante variety.\nThe farmer went into potato farming after retiring as a teacher in 2005, his last posting being Maghimbinyi Primary School.\nHe now concentrates on potato growing, although he further grows maize and beans.\n\"When I got the opportunity to train as a potato breeder, I did not even think twice. I seized the chance to learn best agronomic practices, new technologies and the selection of seeds and storage,\" Mghendi says.\nAfter training, he invested Sh4,250 into the business, money that went into buying 50kg of seeds from Kalro-Tigoni, with each going for Sh60. The rest of the money went to transportation.\nMghendi explains that to produce the seeds, he uses a tractor to plough the land, and then digs furrows for planting.\nDuring the planting, he mixes fertiliser with Black Magic, an organic chemical that prevents the soil from hardening.\nHe then selects quality seeds that are free of diseases for planting.\nThen using a sprayer, the farmer applies Dudu Thrain along the furrows to prevent pests from attacking the seeds in the ground. For the prevention of potato blight that attacks the leaves, he applies Redomil Gold or Milraz.\nAs soon as the potato plant sprouts, he weeds for the first time to break the soil.\nThe seeds mature in two months. But two weeks before maturity, it is advisable that the stems are uprooted to harden the potatoes before harvesting.\n\"After uprooting, I put the seeds in buckets and sort them based on quality before storing in trays,\" says the 65-year-old.\nThe seeds are further sprayed with acetic acid super powder to prevent pests from invading them for quality assurance purposes.\nHe sells the seeds to farmers in Taita County and beyond at Sh50 per kilo. He says there is high demand for seeds among farmers but supply from breeders is inadequate, therefore, a huge opportunity exists in the business.\nSo far this year, he has sold about 3,000kg of potato seeds earning him Sh150,000.\nFrom the proceeds of his potato business, Mghendi last year built an agrovet shop and stocked it with fertiliser, chemicals, animal feeds and seeds at over Sh200,000, part of the money coming from his savings.\n\"I sensed there is need to have a one-stop centre for farmers to buy inputs to reduce the high costs incurred when they go to Wundanyi,\" says Mghendi, who has also constructed a house and a posho mill from the potato business.\nEunice Mwadime, a Ministry of Agriculture officer in Taita, says for one to become a potato breeder, they should own between five to 10 acres that can be used for crop rotation.\n\"They should have a capital of at least Sh100,000. The farmer should also have knowledge from trained breeders at Kalro on seeds selection, diseases, and work closely with the agricultural officers and officers from Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service for advise on the quality of the crops.\"",

After exchanging pleasantries, the farmer leads us into his 8 by 15m greenhouse where he plants yellow capsicum.\n\"I plant this variety because it is in high demand,\" says Kipchumba as he detaches a ripe fruit from one crop.\nBeneath the lush green capsicum plants are black plastic troughs fitted with two drip irrigation pipes feeding the crop with water.\nThe farmer grows the crops in the troughs filled with what looks like black cotton soil.\n\"The growing medium is a mixture of charcoal dust, soil and dried chicken manure,\" says Kipchumba, who went into farming over two years ago.\nHe has grown the crops in eight troughs each measuring 18 metres and holds 100 capsicum plants. A piece of the trough goes for Sh150 in agrovet shops.\nFARMERS' TRANING\nThe troughs and the black soil help him achieve two purposes - curb the deadly bacterial wilt and save water, especially during the dry spell.\nTo prepare the growing medium, he mixes 30 bags of charcoal waste, a tonne of sand soil and 30 bags of chicken manure thoroughly.\nHe then fills it in the troughs before planting the seedlings?\n\"For capsicum seedlings, I first plant them in the seedbed and, thereafter, transplant after a month. But for tomatoes, I plant directly because the transplanted seedlings are normally affected by the greenhouse heat.\"\nKipchumba picked this method of farming from a farmers' training in Eldoret in April last year.\n\"I met a farmer who worked at a flower farm in Naivasha and he was willing to show me. At the farm, they used it to fight soil diseases using the method,\" says the farmer who once lost tomatoes he had planted in the open field on half-an-acre to bacterial wilt.\nInitially, he would harvest 70 crates from the farm but this reduced to less than 50 when bacterial wilt started to attack the crops.\nBacterial wilt also attacks capsicum but ever since he adopted the technology, his crops have not been affected.\n\"I change the soil in the troughs after planting four different crops in different seasons. However, I was taught not to throw away the soil but use it to grow bananas because it is fertile.\"\nOnce the plants are in their third month, he prunes them to allow new flowers to sprout resulting to new generation of capsicums fruits.\n\"So far I have made Sh100,000 selling the produce to Rupa Vegetables Limited and traders at Eldoret town,\" says Kipchumba, 31.\n\"With farming, I have found financial freedom. I am now able to educate my children without any problem.\"\nCOMPOSTED MANURE\nGilbert Kosgei, a former employee of a flower farm in Naivasha, who taught Kipchumba the farming technique, says it helps to curb bacteria wilt and other soil diseases.\n\"I picked the technology that I also use in my three greenhouses from the flower farm. I first tried with different planting materials in the greenhouse and the one I used with mature did well,\" he says.\nHe has since been contracted by Techno-Serve, a non-profit business solution organisation, to construct greenhouses and teach farmers the technology.\nKosgei observes that most farmers in the region had given up on capsicum and tomato due to losses from bacteria wilt.\nProf Nancy Mungai, a soil scientist at Egerton University, agrees that the use of composted chicken manure in soils helps to battle the notorious bacteria wilt.\n\"Alternatively, a farmer should not plant the same crops that are susceptible to bacteria wilt for three years to prevent the disease from wiping out your crop,\" says the soil expert, noting bacterial wilt is a stubborn disease.\nShe notes use of troughs prevents the growing medium from mixing with the infected soil in the greenhouse.",

        "text": "Once upon a time, the animals in the African savannah had a serious distortion in the food chain.\nThings were not working very well. Too many bovids, or cloven-hoofed ruminants, were being killed faster than the grass could grow to feed and nurture more replacements, and keep the ecosystem balanced.\nThe bovids protested bitterly, until the king of the jungle was forced to call a meeting.\nAfter many strategies were discussed, it was agreed that Hare would be a good, neutral and clever enough party to make all the decisions. It was also agreed that there was no way out of Lion eating the bovids, but that Hyena would be the regulator of this interaction.\nFrom this analogy I leave it to Kenyans to discern who the hares are, who the lions are and who the hyenas are. The only person I can identify with is Wanjiku, the bovids.\nKenya, seemingly does not have the ingredients of a nation as would be described by an anthropologist. We are not a homogenous population, we do not have a common culture or language, and a common destiny looks more elusive with each new election.\nWe made the best-ever attempt to create a nation in the Constitution, but living it is proving challenging beyond belief.\nKenya is however a nation-state with a defined population, territory, sovereignty and government.\nVision 2030, Kenya's development blueprint for wealth and employment creation that the government of President Mwai Kibaki launched in 2008, was the closest Kenya ever got to defining a common destiny.\nTIME TO WASTE\nWhat the general populace has in abundance is time to waste, lamenting and then translating that to zero results when elections come knocking.\nKenyans, especially the so-called middle class, should try and spend just 21 days without talking about corruption, interest rates, the downhill trend in the economy, El Nino soap, devolution sex toys, NYS millions and all those other negative things that Wanjiku cannot seem to change at the moment.\nWhat the populace can do is mark the election date for 2017 and draw up a personal list of the people that each of us do not want to see in public office ever again.\nThat is where some of our deepest problems begin. The Republic was convinced that government minsters, now known as Cabinet secretaries needed to be technocrats to have better-run ministries.\nThis has turned out as the best joke of the Constitution. It seems it is only the President - the guy we tried to take the power from - who can actually do anything about them.\nBut all is not lost, the voter can do something about the President. If we vote the President and his deputy out, we are literally throwing the whole selected lot out as well.\nThe 'concocted' nation has been captured by a mania of primitive greed, where the good of society has failed to take precedence over the greed of individuals, yet no one is in jail.\nWhy hasn't there been any effort to put all these greedy people behind bars in spite of all the constitutional offices that taxpayers are breaking their backs to to support?\nI think deep down in our demented psychology, we admire the greed and hope and pray that tomorrow it will be our turn.\nWhy would we talk for five years and elect the same lot almost to the man or woman at the next election?\nNOT SENTIMENTAL\nMoving in to Solutionland, there are some qualities that leaders in Kenya need, from my observation, which will be most useful in holding the 'nation' together.\nWe need leaders who are not sentimental - a very destructive character for public service. If one needs to be sentimental it had better be on their time and money, not at public expense.\nA leader needs to be incorruptible and decisive. Sitting there and acting lame while public coffers are looted relentlessly is the current worst type of corruption. A proverb from my community clearly states that those who abet corruption, especially theft, are as guilty as the thief.\nA leader must be pragmatic. Threatening wrongdoers or being threatened by party 'lose cannons' has been a great weakness of the Jubilee leadership. Nothing, it seems, gets done without 'analysis paralysis', where the party is more interested in its own agenda than the public good.\nKenya needs a more efficient system. The current one is highly inefficient, with too much duplication. Parliament, the public watchdog, is the most inefficient institution, it would seem.\nFinally, I suggest that we put a law in place that does not allow any legislation made by MPs that concerns them to become law during their tenure. That way, they stop making laws for their bellies.\nTwitter: @muthonithangwa",

However I cannot speculate to what extent the prices will fall,\" he said.\nIn Nyeri, tea farmers have threatened to directly source for international markets and drop the agency if the prices fail to improve.\nSeveral activists have joined in the push for better prices and have vowed to campaign for the sacking of the KTDA board accusing it of \"playing games\" in auctions and denying small scale farmers their deserved earnings.\nSpeaking at Gitugi Factory in Othaya, Nyeri County, Mr Kanyago dismissed the threats as petty politics being played by people who want to gain political mileage ahead of the 2017 general election.\n\"We receive guests yearly from foreign countries who want to copy our model.

In Zimbabwe, between 1990 and 2008, access to urban water supply decreased from 97 per cent to 60 per cent, while 75 per cent of hand pumps became non functional.\nIn the Kenyan context, the authors took note of the Kenya Water Act 2002, which made it an offence to construct or employ - without a permit - any works for a purpose for which a permit is required.\nFurthermore, the law excludes large segments of the population from water rights by establishing that only land owners can acquire permits.\nAccording to the authors: \"In all the above options, women and girls should be fully recognised as users of water for multiple purposes, and as producers who both ensure household food security and market produce for rewarding prices.\"\nThe launch of the book in Nairobi next week, will coincide with the current debate on climate change, the end of the UN MDGs and the on-going El Nino rains in some parts of the country.\nAll in all, the authors have done justice to the topic under review and it will add value to debate on climate change, use of scarce natural resources like water, and the link between the precious liquid, gender and the law.",

In fact, some households missed the distribution completely,'' said the elder.\nMarsabit Acting County Commissioner Joseph Sawe say he was unaware of any deaths in the area as a result of hunger.\n\"I will confirm from the area chief on the ground,\" he said.\nHe said the national government had not sent relief supplies to the county since June.\nHe said many hunger stricken families usually throng his office looking for food due to drought in the area.\nA spot check by the Nation revealed that the targeted persons are forced to share their food rations with relatives and other villagers who have nothing to eat while emaciated livestock stroll the villages.\nNO RAINFALL\nThe elders dismissed the Kenya Meteorological Department-predicted El Nino rains as a hoax.\nThey said they had not had rainfall in last three months and do not expect it until April next year.\n\"We as rainmakers have predicted the rains will not be pounding in our land untill next year during the long rains.\n\"We heeded government warning before and stayed around but now our animals are dying in large numbers. We regret it and from tomorrow we shall head to far places in search of pasture and water,'' he said.\nThousands of livestock have also reportedly died across the sub-county. In Shuur, for instance, 1,500 goats reportedly died due to lack of food and pasture.\nMr Bata Tuye, a resident of Maikona, Marsabit North said he had lost 150 of his livestock in past three months and only five of his animals are alive.\n\"I have resorted to feeding them using porridge because they are too weak to stand. I have to look for at least four people to assist me in helping the animals stand,'' he said.\nThe condition of livestock has also deteriorated, leading to price falls. A goat which was fetching Sh7, 000 in June is now selling at Sh500.\nBubisa Chief Mumo Waqo said a trader in the area bought 150 goats for Sh82, 000 last week meaning one fetches on average Sh543.\nMr Patrick Katelo, the chairman of Marsabit Indigenous Organisation Network, a consortium of 12 local NGOs, said the situation is bad and needs urgent humanitarian aid.\nHe said the most affected areas are in North Horr, Marsabit North and Leisamis sub-counties.\n\"We appeal to the government and humanitarian agencies to intervene and avert further deaths due to starvation,'' he said.\nHe said the food donated and cash stipend by the government was doing little to help the situation as families heavily relied on food aid.\nHe warned that the stench of carcasses in the area was also a health hazard as residents were too weak to move them away from their manyattas.\nVULNERABLE POPULATION\nMr Katelo said the most affected are children and lactating mothers, the sick and the elderly.\nKorr-Ngurenet MCA Daud Tomasot said the situation was alarming, adding that at least 50 per cent of the livestock and 80 per cent of residents in his ward were affected.\nHe said neither the county government nor national has heeded his call to distribute food to the residents.\nMr Tomasot said he could not understand why people were suffering, yet he passed a bill in the Assembly for some funds to be set aside for emergencies.\n\"We passed County Emergency Bill for the county government to set aside Sh200m but it is yet to give anything to residents of Ngurenet,'' he lamented.\nHe said one woman from the ward was being treated at the Marsabit Referral Hospital due to malnutrition.\nHe said the area has not received adequate rainfall for last five months resulting in water points drying up and a decline in food availability.\nThe matter had also turned for the worse after the World Food Programme (WFP), which has been feeding about 40,000 locals, announced it was pulling out of the county.\nTwo months ago, the WFP's country director for special programmes, Salim Moora, and the organisation's programme advisor, Ms Helen Bugaari, delivered the terse message to governor Ukur Yatani and the county administration of the decision to transfer the task to the county government.\nThey said donor fatigue could no longer guarantee the humanitarian aid programme that was initially carried out in collaboration with the national government hence the decision to pass it over to devolved units.",

The figure will be disclosed by the governor during the launch of the drive. But we are yet to receive any money from the national government,\" he said.\nIn Narok County, an order by the regional government to families living along rivers and in other disaster-prone areas to move to higher ground is facing resistance from some residents.\nSlum dwellers in Majengo, Kilgoris Town on Thursday vowed to defy the order, saying they did not have anywhere to go.\n\"The area has a history of flooding. They were lucky that last year it flooded during the day,\" said the chief for the area, M Jonathan Sialo.\nIn Meru County, Buuri MP Kinoti Gatobu said his constituency had benefited from five earth dams, built through funds from the national government.\nHe said the dams had been constructed in the following flood-prone areas: Runyenye, Ntumburi, Ruiri, Ntugi and Kibubung'i.\nMr Gatobu said the dams will be filled with water during the rains.",

        "text": "El Nino is coming. Well, as I wipe the sweat off my brow, I can't help but wonder where this guy is. I have never seen Nairobians this scared of rain. There are Whatsapp groups of people who think this is Noah 2.0.\nWhen the trenches were cleared and more were dug, we all knew this is it. Life is about to go from zero to 100 in 10drops. Nairobi is bad when the sun is out, and ugly with a little rain.\nFirst, you have to contend with the fools who sit by the window in a matatu and refuse to open the darn thing insisting that \"Kuna baridi (It is cold).\" Then don't sit there, you dimwit. Or you walk into a restaurant and there's this person by the window who will close it and when asked says Chakula inapoa (The food is getting cold)\". Can we jail these fellows together with the corrupt?\nBut I do not know why I am surprised, Nairobians love being in crowded spots. Heck, Nairobi is one crowded city but it's not like anybody wants some space unless you are claustrophobe like yours truly. I don't even know why a Nairobi girl would tell her boyfriend that she needs some space, that is impossible. If you want space, you have to hop into a 2NK and go to Nyeri.\nGive me a pub or a bar that is spacious. I doubt there are bars or pubs that have a dancing spot anymore. Every space has a table these days and each sits around 13 people. Even the 5,000 who were fed by Jesus had room to eat.\nYou get into a bar and it is so dark and crowded, you feel like you have just walked into a room full of illegal immigrants. Everybody is literally next to each other and nobody seems to mind.\nSAFETY IN NUMBERS\nI went to a club the other day and it was so full that you had to hold your drink, then instead of bringing the glass to your mouth, you had to bend to reach the glass. You can't even make a call without displacing some 15 people.\nHave you ever walked over to where your friends are and proceeded to shake hands with 45 people, only to realise that even your friends don't know who they are? Wait, why do Nairobians love shaking hands so much? If I shook your hands in January, we are done for the year but there are people who will shake hands every two hours. If you are one of those people, get help. But I digress.\nIf you come to Kimathi Street on a Friday night, you will see that people pouring out of the clubs onto the pavement. They literally put tables outside on the pavement, and they are still crowded.\nI think if you were to put a Nairobian in a field alone, they would go nuts. Their brains wouldn't function because they are not used to not being next to 30 other living beings.\nI think that is why most Whatsapp groups have 50 people. I still can't figure out what I would say to those many people when I am not seeking an electoral post. Can the El Nino rains drown these groups please?\nAway from the clubs, have you noticed that Nairobians can't seem to function when alone on the road? We love traffic. Watch how they drive once they are past Kangemi, Ruiru or Athi River, it is a battle of dimwits. They hoot and overlap, even when it is a cow crossing the road. That is why we are usually so calm in gridlock.\nAs for matatus, folks, we are so used to being packed into the vehicles that the touts have to pay some idle kids to sit inside one and make it look like it is almost full.\nYou jump in thinking you are about to move, only to realise that you were actually the first genuine passenger and you want to weep. But it is a brilliant idea, I must say. You then hop out and get into an already full matatu where you will sit between seats and proceed to give your gluteus maximus a thorough workout. Woe unto you if the road is bumpy, you will leave that vehicle feeling like a tectonic shift just happened in your body.\nEven our homes are crowded. Your neighbour probably has his entire village in his house because they are studying computer packages in some dingy college that is a scandal in waiting.\nGive yourself some space.",

However, this time, the rains have come early and where they have been received, they are slightly heavier compared (with) other years. This is a sign that (the) effects of El Nino is being felt,\" Mr Mwangi said.\nHe noted that the storms have been hitting parts of coastal and northern Kenya. In Garissa County, floods have already displaced several people.\n\"These are signs of heavy rainfall coming because such downpours are rarely experienced in Garissa,\" Mr Mwangi said.\n\"Before October 20, Kenyans should expect substantial rains, which would continue all the way to December and even in January,\" he added.\nHeavy rains have also been experienced in Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu counties and farmers are complaining that continuous showers are interfering with maize harvesting, according to Mr Mwangi.\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE\n\"When you look at the bigger picture, we rarely have such rains in early October,\" he insists.\nEven if Nairobi and its environs have not received the rains as predicted, Mr Mwangi said: \"The signs are there and rains are surely coming.\"\nOther areas where some showers have been reported include Kisumu, Kakamega, Homa Bay, Busia, Marsabit, Isiolo, Mombasa, Meru, Nyeri, Kericho, and Kisii.\nThe government has formed a multi-agency team, coordinated by the National Disaster Operations Centre, to deal with disaster response during the rains.\nThis team has officials from the ICT ministry, the Kenya Red Cross Society and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nIn Nairobi, residents are anticipating a disaster in areas where contractors are busy digging trenches to construct roads, culverts or drainage systems, just in case it really rains.\nIn the Mukuru kwa Njenga slum in Nairobi, the only road that people use is under construction. The contractor has left open pits that locals say pose a major risk to them.",

I had told him as long as we worked together, he would have a lot of travel opportunities and sleep in good hotels.\nDuring the show, I booked him in a hotel that was charging Sh1,500 for bed and breakfast. The breakfast, which consisted of two sausages, a toasted bread, a glass of juice, an egg and white coffee, impressed him.\nNow back at Mashambani, Muchiri is a sort of celebrity. At Hotel Check Point owned by Wakageorge, the whole story of the show has been topping conversations. Wakageorge is a known rumour monger. He started as an electronics repairer dealing with radios, watches, torches and even TVs.\nCHECK POINT HOTEL\nHowever, when the Chinese electronics started to flood the market, he converted the electronics shop into a liquor den. This went on for years before our MP, nicknamed KK, waged war against the drinks. It is after the invasion of his liquor den by the public that he converted the room into a hotel. This is now christened Check Point.\nMuchiri is a frequent customer at Check Point. We supply milk to Wakageorge although I think Muchiri mainly goes there to take tea, mandazi and gossip.\nWakageorge is the village's FBI. The guy never leaves Check Point but he seems to have information on all that happens in the villages. He even has information that we refused to sell our bull for Sh500,000. It is at this hotel where rumours went round that I no longer go to the cooperative office as the chairman, and I have instead concentrated on building Mkulima Mixed Farm.\nSo when Wakageorge invited me to his hotel to review how I could increase milk supply from three to seven litres, I found the meeting important.\nAs I approached the hotel door, I overheard a hot debate. I could recognise Muchiri's voice as one of the guys shouting and I held myself back to listen. \"We were staying next to the weatherman,\" said Muchiri while referring to the Meteorological Department near Jamhuri showground. \"What information did you get about the El Nino? I hear all Mashambani farms will have landslides. People like Mkulima have to relocate their cows,\" said Wakageorge.\n\"El Nino is coming. Be prepared. It will flood all over,\" Muchiri started.\nMuchiri now seemed confused. He had heard of El Nino but he wasn't sure what it was. He heard it was there almost 20 years ago. He heard farmers being advised to take insurance but had no idea what agriculture insurance is.\n\"Wacha hii story ya El Nino, itakuja na itaenda,\" Muchiri tried to brush it off so that he can continue with his Nairobi exploits story. \"El Nino is more important. You were the people who were in Nairobi, where all information comes from,\" said Wakageorge.\n\"So which crops should we grow during the El nino rains?\" said a man whom I recognised as our MCA.\n\"I think maize can do better,\" answered Muchiri. \"But the weatherman keeps on saying that the rains will be above average.\"\nThere is no way I could miss the hot debate. I entered the hotel, sat and listened, but when I was about to contribute Mzee Jeremiah, my village enemy opened his mouth.\nBIGGER CHALLENGE\n\"I hear people like Mkulima have been advised to move to higher grounds,\" he said.\n\"Why should I move to higher grounds,\" I interjected with anger.\n\"My great grandparents stayed in this farm for many years, many El Nino rains have come leaving the farm intact.\nIt seemed Mzee Jeremiah was happy that I might be moved to higher grounds and I may lose my crops and animals. In short, my whole farm.\nI walked out in protest wondering what to do with the El Nino rains so that I can save my entire business. I scratched my head and two things came up. First, I thought I should harvest all my strawberries and other fruits to avoid losses. Second, I was to ferry my animals to my friend in Ukambani.\nBut the more I thought, the clearer it became that the challenge was bigger. The two ideas could not work because I could not immediately get market for the strawberry if I harvested and second, taking the cows to Ukambani was no solution because the area was also going to be affected. I have been wracking my mind and enduring sleepless nights since then, but I have not found a solution.",

The last paper for the examination on November 5 will be Geography Braille paper two, at noon.\nThe examinations start nine days earlier than the tradition - usually a day after Mashujaa fete.\nCandidates will be sitting for theory papers after concluding oral and practical examinations, which started on September 28 and ended on October 6.\nThe theory examination starts a week after teachers called off their month-long strike that interfered with the preparations of candidates. Teachers' union leaders and parents had asked the government to postpone the examination owing to the strike that delayed the start of the term by five weeks, but the request was rejected by the government.\nA total of 35,434 supervisors and 91,387 invigilators will be involved across 35,045 examination centres in the country. Distribution of examination material has also been concluded.\nKenya National Examination Council Senior Deputy Secretary Ambia Noor said the council is ready for the examination, with plans for any emergency such as El Nino floods already in place.\nMs Noor added that 25,391 examiners have since been trained in readiness for marking, which will be done in 31 centres across the country.\n\"We are ready to go and expect candidates to stick to the guidelines issued to them and avoid engaging in any form of malpractice,\" she said.\nShe added that county directors of education, TSC county heads from North Eastern region and security agencies are working together to ensure there are no hitches. She ruled out postponement of the examination in North Eastern region, saying students in the area are ready for the examination.\n\"We have not received any request to postpone the examination in the area. Therefore, it will go on as planned,\" added the Senior Deputy Secretary.\nShe disclosed that 500 officials from the Education ministry and Knec will also monitor the exercise, and cautioned students against malpractices.\n\"Disciplinary action will be taken against officials who abet cheating in their stations,\" she said. The Senior Deputy Secretary also said candidates who were not registered for the examination will not be allowed to sit for it.\nTSC chief executive officer Nancy Macharia told teachers not to engage in any form of malpractice, saying they would face disciplinary action if they did so.\n\"We expect our teachers to abide by the code of conduct they signed. Once we get reports and evidence of any malpractice, we will take the necessary action,\" said Mrs Macharia.\nAt the same time, Education Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi has sent a goodwill message to all candidates and asked them to avoid all temptations to cheat, noting that the consequences were severe.\nMatayos MP Geoffrey Odanga told the council to seal all loopholes that contribute to cheating in national examinations.\n\"There is laxity in terms of examination administration. The ministry, together with Knec, must uphold the credibility of the exercise,\" said Mr Odanga.\nMeanwhile, school heads in North Eastern region are worried about the performance of students in the area after several teachers declined to work there due to insecurity.\nKenya Secondary School Heads Association Garissa branch secretary Khalif Sheikh Issack said the required syllabus has not been covered in many schools in the region, making it difficult for schools to post good results.\nIn Mandera, county director of education Ismael Barrow said the government had addressed teacher shortages in the county. \"We have assigned supervisors and invigilators and everyone is ready for the task. Despite the teacher shortage, all the centres have sufficient personnel,\" said Mr Barrow.\nMandera County Commissioner Fredrick Shisia said mapping of areas that could be cut off by El-Nino rains is complete, as is acquiring of helicopters to facilitate transportation of examination papers.\n\"We have enough security personnel dispatched to examination centres. We call upon locals to be the primary security guarantors,\" said Mr Shisia.\nHe said apart from dispatching security officers,, technical officials are also on the ground ready to assist in case of heavy rains.\nReports by Ouma Wanzala, Abdimalik Hajir And Manase Otsialo",

        "text": "Last week was promising. First, after a series of visits, the agricultural show officials finally informed me that the bull I co-own with Ken has what it takes to be exhibited at Nairobi Show next week.\n\"We have checked its weight, size, skin and good records and we are impressed,\" said Mr Julius Otieno, the lead judge. I was excited but I was also worried about its temper.\nSecond and most important, I received a call from Kavu, who introduced himself as a businessman in the tourism industry. He had chosen my farm to host local tourists from Nairobi.\nI instantly thought this would be another jackpot after the lucrative training a few weeks ago that brought trouble to my farm when Muchiri, my farm boy, started pushing for a salary rise.\n\"Listen, Mkulima,\" Kavu began explaining. \"Nowadays, agritourism is growing. People want to see serious farms with the hope of starting their own.\"\n\"But Kavu, we don't allow visitors on weekdays,\" I said sounding strict. \"At Bonfire, we only do it on Fridays,\" he said revealing his tour firm.\nFriday morning was busy for Muchiri. By the way, his two-week notice isn't over, so he is still working. That morning, I was preparing our farm for the El nino rains, which the weatherman has warned will be 'above normal'. Whatever that means.\nAGRITOURISM\nAt exactly 11am, a modern tourist bus never seen in Mashambani before slowly made its way to the narrow road leading to our farm. Several villagers ran after it as the driver seemed to struggle to manoeuvre through the path.\nWhen the bus stopped at the farm's gate, about 22 young girls clad in black boots, caps and white t-shirts disembarked. They seemed to be in their early 20s and likely in college going by the sheng they spoke.\nSome had high-heel block shoes, micro mini-skirts with stockings, some makeups, nice well-polished nails, designer clothes and earphones. Some had even come with their pets - small snow-white dogs, the size of our village cats, which they were cuddling.\nThese clients revealed a new world to me; that there are university students who have never seen a cow's udder, leave alone coming close to the animal.\n\"Welcome to Mkulima Mixed Farm,\" I said in my Mashambani accent as I extended my hand to greet them as we always do to visitors. To my shock, none was interested in shaking my rough, dirty hand. \"Oh yea..We are fine,\" two girls of mixed race politely said as they looked at my hand, almost in disbelief.\nI knew these were not the 'class training type' that serious farmers keep sending to my farm. They needed just an exciting farm day.\nAs I thought of what to do, the overzealous Muchiri outsmarted me and managed to give two a firm handshake. \"Ouuch, you gonna break my fingers!\" one girl shouted. \"Muchiri pole pole,\" I warned him.\nThe girls' accent and tweng' seemed to confuse Muchiri. He kept responding, \"Yeah..Yeah\" to their queries even when the answer was a \"No\".\n\"You guys go to the gym?\" one girl asked while admiring Muchiri's biceps. \"No, we don't,\" I answered before Muchiri could answer \"Yeah... Yeah...\"\n\"Did you know that the latest and best anti-wrinkle cream is made from bee venom?\" I started my training. All the ladies were attentive when the issue of beauty was mentioned.\nWhen they started admiring the strawberries, it was time to impress. \"Strawberries are often whimsically called the fruits of love,\" I said. \"Ahh..\" they uttered in unison\n\"So this is how a strawberry plant looks like?\" one of them asked. She had never seen one.\n\"Look at the strawberry,\" I continued with my romantic description of agriculture. \"It's a perfect little red heart, an edible Valentine,\" I continued. \"The best way to consume it is by dipping in a premium chocolate cream.\" The only responses I could hear were \"Waooh!\" \"Amazing!\" \"Really?\"\nBy the time I was finishing on strawberry, they were scrambling for the potted seedlings. My effort to make agriculture sexy had borne fruits.\n\"Now, welcome to Cowdashians, they are the socialites on this farm,\" I said as I introduced my zero-grazing Friesians.\" \"Cowdashians!\" They exclaimed as they all burst into laughter\n\"Yes, Cowdashians,\" I confirmed.\nTAKE SELFIES\n\"It all started here at Mkulima Mixed Farm when I made the cows 'socialites' on Mkulima Young Facebook page,\" I started explaining the story behind the animals.\n\"I always posted their photos every day like the socialites do,\" I added.\nThe Cowdashians impressed the girls, as they all wanted to touch their udders and squeeze the milk out. This was their first experience.\nBy now, their obsessions with make-up had drastically reduced. All they wanted was to feel the udder.\nThey then took several selfies with the cows and the crops. I overheard them saying they are uploading them on Instagram.\n\"You can tag Mkulima Young,\" I said to one lady. \"Are you on Instagram?\" she asked. \"No, I am on Facebook,\" I answered. \"We are on Instagram, Facebook is too old,\" she said.\nAs they admired my farm house with nice flowers and neat compound, I could hear them wishing to spend a week in the farm. \"Do you have cottages here,\" a lady asked. \"Not yet. Soon we shall have,\" I answered quickly not even knowing what they were.\n\"Kumbe unajua kuongea kizungu cha Amerika,\" Muchiri teased me after they had left. Before I answered, Kavu sent me Sh33,000 via M-Pesa. \"22 visitors @Sh1,500. Lukin 4ward.\" A message followed.\n\"Now you want to resign when we have just started receiving visitors?\" I asked Muchiri in my effort to make him change his mind. \"Mmmmhh! We can negotiate,\" Is all Muchiri said, the girls having mesmerised him. He no longer seemed eager to leave the farm.",

        "text": "How do you describe the current drought situation in your county?\nWe are facing a severe drought and some residents, particularly in Wamba and Samburu East, are the hardest hit. We have purchased at least 7,000 bags of maize and beans through the Samburu Pastoral Livelihoods Improvement Programme, which is funded by the European Union to a tune of Sh290 million. All the residents now have enough food to sustain them during this dry spell.\nBesides the donor assistance, what is your government doing to mitigate the effects of drought?\nWe have set aside Sh50 million for emergency. The county and the national government have also partnered to deal with the effects of the drought and the coming El Nino rains.\nThat aside, what measurers are you taking to boost agriculture?\nSamburu falls under the arid and semi-arid lands and the residents are predominantly pastoralists. However, my government has started several projects to change the peoples' mind-set so that we can stop the reliance on relief food. We have a total of 139,892 hectares of arable land, which is unexploited. We have bought 26 tractors and we are also providing other inputs such as seeds and fertiliser to ensure our people invest in crop farming.\nSamburu County is water deficit. What steps have you taken to ensure there is enough water for livestock?\nWe have increased the number of watering points by digging dams, water pans and wells at strategic places to enable people and animals access water. These projects are currently supporting 400 households and about 7,000 livestock.\nSome farmers who have embraced crop farming have complained that their counterparts from neighbouring Laikipia and Nyandarua are flooding the market with produce even when there is good harvest. What is your take on this?\nThis is a free market, thus, we cannot stop people from selling to us. However, we have taken steps to ensure our farmers remain competitive, for instance, by providing them with tractors, subsidised seeds and fertiliser. But that said, Samburu is still food deficient, thus, there is huge market for farmers from other parts of the country.\nDoes that mean you are not helping farmers market their produce?\nWe are improving infrastructure to make sure all roads to the market centres are accessible during the dry and rainy seasons. We have set aside funds to train our women and youths on marketing strategies. We are also putting in place a system where we shall buy excess food from our farmers and give it to students to keep them in school.\nHuman-animal conflict is a major problem in the county and many farmers have constantly complained of invasion of their farms by wild animals...\nWild life invasion is a big problem but we are in constant contact with the Kenya Wildlife Service because we must coexist in the same environment with the animals. We have pursued genuine cases to make sure our farmers are well compensated for lost crops and animals.\nLivestock is a key economic activity in Samburu County. What plans do you have to turn it into a top earner?\nWe have started a major vaccination campaign to improve the livestock health and yields.\nLivestock farmers are also being taught about climate change adaptation and mitigation. The farmers are also taught basic disease-control strategies and how to access good markets.\nWe have plans to construct abattoirs in 31 trading centres where farmers will also benefit from value addition.",

If what the weatherman is proclaiming is anything to go by, it appears like my old man asked for an inch and was given a mile.\nRemember the story about the boy who was a pathological liar and kept crying wolf? It seems as though Kenya's weatherman was cut from the same cloth as that lad. He (the weatherman) has made prophecies in the past that never came to be. So when I heard that he had predicted another El-Nino, I dismissed it as a bluff.\nBut I started taking the warning seriously when I saw the government clearing roadside drainages with the ferocity of a teenage girl trying to clean her parents' house before they come back from work. So I ran it by Grandpa Richard to discover whether there was an iota of truth in the doomsday-scenario predictions that are vouched to happen this month.\nJust the mention of the word El-Nino made the frail greybeard recoil in his skin. He sorrowfully narrated how, many years ago, when most of my comrades were tootling tots barely out of their nappies, the great El-Nino of '98 struck.\nMAKE PEACE\n\"If any of your comrades has annoyed the Good Lord lately, mostly with their marijuana-smoking habits, I advise that they make peace with Him to avoid being struck by thunder - literally,\" warned my old man. It happened in 1998; more than 600 people lost their lives. Millions of livestock, including Grandpa's prized bull, drowned in the floods.\nMy comrades are heeding the El-Nino warning with worrisome gravitas too. They are planning a vigil outside Anniversary Towers to petition Helb officials to disburse their student loans immediately to help them plan for the downpour.\nNo, my comrades don't intend to buy canoes, or even umbrellas; they just want to stock up enough beer in their rooms to last them until the next general elections.\nThere is a theory doing the rounds in our campuses that if two or three lie together, they'll be able to keep warm during the El-Nino rains. In my books, buying an extra duvet is more effective and way cheaper than getting a girlfriend for the cold season. Just because Noah stocked his ark with a pair from each species does not mean you should couple up every time it as much as drizzles.\nThe El-Nino rains might just be the best time to introduce my old man to Instagram. In order to obey the weather, comrades will have no choice but to cover up those acres of bare skin. The raunchy callipygian figures that appear on Instagram will be replaced with decent photos of girls dressed up like cabbage dealers from Mukurweini.\nAnd did I mention no male comrade is planning on taking a shower for the entire period that the rains will last?\nTake care, comrades.",

Unless addressed, flooding and droughts will get worse,\" Mr Namwamba said.\nHe said since 2008, dykes had been built and trees planted at a cost of Sh500 million.\n\"What used to be a floodplain is now an irrigation scheme and we must not allow El Nino to destroy it,\" he added.\nIn its alert in August, the Kenya Meteorological Department asked the country to be prepared for El Nino rains.\nThe weatherman said the short rains from October to December would lead to floods and landslides in many parts of the country including Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Nyamira, Migori, Kisii, Busia, Vihiga, Kakamega, Bungoma and counties in Rift Valley.\nIt, however, said the onset of the rains for Nyanza and Western counties would not be clear as the occasional rains in September were expected to continue into the first week of October and spill over into January 2016.",

Those structures and facilities are there,\" Mr Ruto said during the meeting at his official residence in Karen, Nairobi.\nThe meeting was attended by Cabinet secretaries Eugene Wamalwa (Water) and Judy Wakhungu (Environment), principal secretaries David Lesiyampe and Mwanamaka Mabruki and other government and county officials.\nThe meeting resolved that government officers should not factor any allowances for themselves while performing the emergency functions.\nWARNED STAFF\nCounty governments have already warned their staff that they should not expect any allowances above their salaries while working during the anticipated disruptions.\nEducation ministry officials said they were prepared to airlift national examinations in the event roads were rendered impassable.\nThe United Nations Children's Fund, the World Health Organisation and mobile provider Safaricom have also expressed interest in helping the government mitigate the problem.\nThe committee said it is important to immediately mobilise resources to acquire the required materials.\nMr Ruto said: \"All sectors need to be fully involved in the preparations to protect lives and property ahead of the expected rains. Awareness creation needs to be intensified among communities.\"\nThe technical team, under the Interior ministry, was formed two weeks ago to work out a coherent plan with measures to be undertaken in specific counties to lessen the adverse effects of the anticipated floods.\nAccording to the El Nino contingency strategic plan for 2014-2018, 1.5 million people could be in need of direct assistance as a result of the floods.\nOut of these, 500,000 are expected to be refugees, who will be addressed by the UNHCR, while one million are people in various locations who will form the target of the strategic plan.\nAFFECTED AREAS\nThe plan states that the areas likely to be affected most by El Nino are in northern Kenya (Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit and Garissa), the southeastern parts of the country (Kitui, Makueni, Machakos) and areas along the coast (Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale, Tana River and Taita-Taveta).\nOthers are the Kano plains, Budalang'i and the Tana delta.\nThe risk of landslides is expected in areas with steep slopes in central Kenya (Murang'a, Nyeri, and Meru) and along the Rift Valley escarpment.",

        "text": "Maize farmers are staring at a crisis, owing to the East African trade protocol that is increasingly allowing import of cheaper maize from Uganda and Tanzania.\nUganda, whose harvesting season started in August, has already imported to Kenya huge quantities of cheaper maize, creating panic among farmers in the North Rift, Kenya's food basket. The farmers are set to start harvesting in a month, just like those in Tanzania.\nThe EAC Protocol allows free movement of goods between East African countries - with the exception of sugar, which Kenya has restricted to protect its industries and farmers.\nThe protocol also opposes the capping of maize prices by respective governments, in favour of market forces. Kenya, a net importer of maize, has been under pressure to implement the protocol fully.\nIt traditionally depends on Uganda and Tanzania, which are surplus producers, to bridge the gap. But the two countries have been unable to fully exploit the market due to price setting by the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB).\nThe board is the largest buyer of the staple grain and acts as the country's maize central bank. When it sets a price, dealers adjust their prices accordingly, creating a ripple effect at both production and consumer levels.\nThe price of maize across major towns is currently Sh2,900 for a 90-kg bag, except in Kisumu where it is retailing at Sh3,100. But maize from Uganda is already in the country, going for between Sh1,200 and Sh1,500 per bag in Eldoret. This is causing panic among farmers.\nWORLD-WIDE PRACTICE\n\"We cannot allow a free market for a commodity that the majority of farmers depend on; that is the practice all over the world,\" Kenya Farmers Association (KFA) director Menjo Kipkorir said.\nAccording to KFA, about Sh1,800 is needed to produce a bag of maize in Kitale. Small-holder farmers are set to be the biggest losers, it says.\n\"Large-scale farmers with private drying and storage systems will most likely hold on to their maize, but small-scale farmers - who are the majority - will have no option but to sell. They will suffer losses,\" said Mr Menjo.\nKenya continues to be a dominant economic force in the East African Community, exporting goods worth Sh105 billion to Uganda and Tanzania anually, compared with imports worth Sh27 billion from the two countries.\nBut it is increasingly under pressure to allow free flow of maize from Uganda and Tanzania, which accounted for 27.2 per cent and 35.9 per cent of the total imports, respectively.\nThis would mean doing away with price setting, leaving local farmers to suffer losses as traders and millers opt for cheaper maize from the two EAC countries.\nAgriculture principal secretary Cecily Kariuki told Sunday Nation that the government had set aside Sh2.5 billion for this financial year to purchase maize from farmers starting October, adding that they were yet to set a price.\n\"This would be determined by the going prices in neighbouring countries, the cost of production, amount of subsidisation, retail prices in Kenya and the weather patterns. Local farmers should not be worried,\" she said.\n\"As any government would do in a similar situation, we will balance the interests of all stakeholders,\" she said.\nData from the Regional Agricultural Trade Intelligence Network (Ratin), a software run by the Eastern African Grain Council that monitors cross-border trade, shows that an average 1,200 tonnes of maize crosses into Kenya from Uganda every day.\nMatters have been complicated by the impending El Nino rains, which are likely to coincide with the harvesting period, leaving farmers with no option but to sell at whatever cost to avoid losses. The other option is to dry the maize using dryers, but high energy prices make this option prohibitive.",

Traders had 2.3 million bags with millers' stocks standing at 1.1 million bags. The National Produce and Cereals Board (NCPB) had 4 million bags of maize at the beginning of the month.\nBean stocks totalled 900,000 bags, wheat 3.6 million and rice 300,000 bags.\n\"The current maize balance sheet shows that available stocks are adequate to meet national needs for the next four months with a surplus of 12 million bags by December 2015,\" Mr Mohamed said.\nEl Nino has the potential of wiping out the expected gains, especially as the harvesting season approaches.\nCLIMATE CHANGE TALKS\nIn June, during the Bonn climate change talks, scientists warned that farmers in Africa and East Asia could suffer crop losses as extreme weather linked to the El Nino phenomenon alters rainfall patterns.\nMr James Kinyangi, senior adviser to the research group Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) was quoted saying that substantial losses of beans, potatoes and maize are expected in parts of Kenya since El Nino is creating the \"perfect conditions\" for an outbreak of rust or other plant diseases in some wheat-growing areas of East Africa.\nThe Kenya Met Department said the above normal rainfall expected in most agricultural areas and its likelihood of having good distribution should be a good motivation for farmers double their efforts to reap maximum yields.\nHowever, producers need to be aware of the prevalence of diseases due to high moisture levels that may cause of post-harvest losses.",

In the slums however it will be yet another season of death, tears, pain, destruction, disease and sleepless nights.\nThe meteorology department has in the last few weeks been issuing warnings over possible destruction of infrastructure. Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero too issued a similar warning last week telling people living near rivers to move to higher ground.\nIn the informal settlements where a majority of the residents live near river banks or abandoned quarries, the lurking danger appears to have been largely ignored.\nIn Kibera the confluence between the Mutoine River and Ngong River in Kibera as they flow into the Nairobi Dam in the east turns into a raging flood plain that causes destruction to part of Gatwekera and Kisumu villages each rainy season.\nLast week it was business as usual despite the residents admitting to the Sunday Nation that they are aware of the impending danger and destruction the rains will bring. Some said they can't heed to warnings since they have nowhere else to go.\nIn May, dozens of houses were washed away at this spot which Jacob Opondo, a tailor said was the worst season in the 10 years he has lived there.\n\"We could not sleep for several nights. The noise alone that comes from the river as it rages makes you fear that you will be washed away if you sleep,\" he recalled.\n\"But I am used to the rains. The El Nino will come, destroy a few houses but it won't last forever and people will rebuild as they have always done,\" he concludes.\nHis neighbour Evelyn Kizito rules out moving out from her house for fear it might be occupied by another person.\n\"Getting a house is difficult in Kibera. You move your things out even if it is for a few days and a new person will and occupy it,\" she said.\n\"The landlords are only interested in money, whoever lives in the house or whether it gets destroyed by the rain is none of their problems so it is up to you to safeguard your tenancy,\" she said.\nDuring the last rainy season, Ms Kizito who has four children endured long nights of draining water from her house. It is a routine she has done for three years.\n\"There's a pit latrine on the river bank nearby, and as the waters rose, raw sewage overflowed into the house and my two boys got diarrhoea,\" she said.\n\"The government has just told people to move but no one is telling people where they should go to or how they will survive,\" said Victoria Makove, another resident.\nThe National Disaster Operations Centre has said the expected rains will be above normal.\n\"The expected \"above normal\" rains will be 125 per cent more than Kenya gets during normal season. Such high amounts of rain will result in flash floods and high moisture levels, promoting the breeding of disease-causing organisms,\" warned the Centre's director Nathan Kigotho.\nIn May, 10 people died after the perimeter wall of the South B Mosque collapsed on shanties in Mukuru Fuata Nyayo slums at night. Another four people were swept away in Kayole and one in Ruaraka in June while dozens died of cholera broke out in Kibera. Across the city in Embakasi's Mabatini slum, a four-year-old girl was electrocuted as she was playing.\nIt is a cycle that experts say is increasingly getting worse due to urbanisation and destruction of forest cover.\n\"During the rainy season, forests act as sponges, sucking up rainfall and controlling flows downstream, hence preventing floods,\" said Dr Joseph Mutemi of the University of Nairobi's Department of Meteorology.\n\"In urban areas, construction of concrete buildings is to blame for annual flooding in low-lying areas especially in slums,\" he said.\nAll drainage systems in the city direct water out of the capital through two main channels - Nairobi and Mutoine rivers.\nNairobi River runs from Kileleshwa to Westlands and crosses the city centre at Globe Cinema Round About before leaving the city to join Athi River.\nMutoine River originates in Ngong Forest, runs through Kibera into Nairobi Dam which acts as a temporary reservoir before heading to Nairobi West and Industrial Area before leaving the city through Kayole to join Athi River.\nFamilies have built houses just next to the rivers which flood heavily during the rainy season.",

        "text": "Suspicion is growing about the government's decision to empty its strategic grain reserve and sell maize to millers at a low price, just a few weeks to the harvesting season in the country's food basket.\nThe National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) on Tuesday cut the price of maize to Sh2,300 per bag and released 2.4 million bags from the strategic reserve. The government said the move would check the runaway flour prices. This is the largest number of bags NCPB has released at a go in recent years.\nMaize flour prices have been escalating in the past eight months. Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics released this week indicates that the price of a two-kilogram packet of maize flour rose to an average Sh115 last month, up from Sh88 in January.\nThe government says that releasing maize to millers will stabilise the market by pushing down the price of the staple food. \"In any situation, we need to balance the interests of all stakeholders,\" Principal Secretary for Agriculture Cecily Kariuki told Sunday Nation.\n\"Our intention is to influence the supposed escalation of prices on the consumer side,\" she said.\nBut similar price manoeuvres have often ended up hurting farmers or consumers, instead of lowering the price of maize flour. This price is mainly dictated by the cost of buying and producing maize.\nIn April, the release of 500,000 bags by NCPB failed to achieve the intended purpose after millers shunned the maize citing quality concerns. At that time, the price of maize flour was Sh104 for a 2kg packet. Both millers and farmers have for a long time been pressuring the government to allow market forces to dictate the prices.\nKenya is a maize deficit country. It depends on inflows from neighbouring states to meet the demand.\nData from Regional Agricultural Trade Intelligence Network (Ratin), a software run by Eastern African Grain Council that monitors cross-border trade across the East Africa Community, shows that an average 1,200 tonnes of maize crosses into Kenya from Uganda each day.\nBut these imports have not helped to bring down the cost of the staple food as cartels wanting to profit from a deficit hold on to these consignments and sell them later to millers at hefty profits.\nAccording to the government, the country had 14.6 million bags of maize as at September 1. Of these, farmers are hoarding 6.7 million bags, traders 2.4 million and millers 1.2 million bags in their warehouses.\nThe NCPB, the country's main grain bank, is the largest buyer of maize in Kenya. When it sets a price, dealers lower or increase their prices to match what it has offered, creating a ripple effect in the market. Currently, the price of maize across major towns is Sh2,900 per 90-kg bag, except in Kisumu where it is retailing at Sh3,100.\nReleasing such a huge quantity of maize into the market, and at Sh2,300, just when most farmers in the north rift are expecting the next harvest, is likely to benefit the top players. The greatest losers will be small scale farmers as they will have to sell their produce at lower prices. Large scale farmers and dealers will most likely hold out.\nAccording to the Kenya Farmers Association (KFA), it costs Sh1,800 to produce a bag of maize in Kitale.\n\"Large scale farmers who have their own drying and storage systems will likely hoard their maize. But small scale farmers, who are the majority, will have to sell immediately and suffer loses,\" said the association's director Menjo Kipkorir.\nMatters have been complicated further by the impending El-Nino rains, predicted to commence at the start of the harvesting period. This could leave farmers with no option but to sell at whatever price to avoid losses.\nThe other option is to dry the maize and store it, but high prices of electricity and fuel could make this prohibitive. Also, only maize whose moisture content is not above 18 per cent can be dried in the machines. This means the maize should not have been rained on and it should have stayed in the fields for some weeks after maturity.\n\"With the coming rains, driers are going to exploit farmers, just like in the past. I'm foreseeing a situation where we could be protesting at NCPB offices, like we did last December, since we are clearly headed for a crisis,\" said Mr Menjo.\nThe Sunday Nation learnt that the 10,000-acre Galana Kulalu Irrigation project is also expecting its first harvest, which will further complicate matters for farmers. The Sh260 billion scheme is a partnership between the government and private players.\nMeanwhile, KFA says the move to empty the national grain reserves could actually be aimed at creating room for incoming maize, much more than easing the cost of the staple crop.\nThe Jubilee government has been struggling to prove the viability of the Galana project, which has been plagued with criticism. The opposition Cord says that growing maize under irrigation is expensive.\nAnd even within the ruling coalition, URP has treated the irrigation scheme with suspicion as residents of the Rift Valley, where the political party draws its support, are the main producers of maize in Kenya.\nIn July, there were objections by the URP wing of government over relinquishing of the irrigation docket from Agriculture ministry, whose CS Felix Koskey is on suspension, to the Water ministry under Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa - an appointee of President Uhuru Kenyatta (TNA).\nThese latest developments could drive the wedge further in the TNA-URP coalition.",

We should provide factual information and avoid lying,\" he said.\nHeavy rains in May this year wreaked havoc and claimed some lives in Narok and Nairobi.\nIn the same month, a mosque in Fuata Nyayo slums in Nairobi's South B collapsed, killing 10 people.

Tens of lives were lost, and property, both private and public was damaged. Roads and bridges were washed away in some parts of the country, effectively paralysing transport in those areas.\nThe worst hit areas were Narok and Nairobi. For instance, on May 12, 10 people lost their lives in the Fuata Nyayo slums in the city's South B after the wall of a mosque collapsed on them. Eight others were injured.\nOn a number of days, the rains were extremely heavy in the city, wreaking havoc on transport and leaving many people stranded on the roads for hours.\nMaureen Naliaka, who lives in Ongata Rongai, about 20 kilometres from the city, recalls arriving home at 5.30 am on two occasions, with just enough time to freshen up and begin her journey back to town to work.\n\"I remember one day it rained from 3.30pm to 8pm and on arriving at the bus stage, I found a very long queue. I eventually got a bus but since there was heavy traffic because the roads were flooded, I arrived in Rongai at dawn. I have never been as anxious to arrive home as I was that day,\" Ms Naliaka recalls.\nThat same night, pupils from Makini School spent the night in their bus, which had got stuck in the middle of raging floodwaters in South C in the city. Several other roads were rendered impassable by the floods.\nAccording to the Meteorological Department, the rains experienced in May were among the worst to occur in recent times, with the meteorological station in Dagoretti, Nairobi, recording up to 189mm of rainfall, which was higher than the average for the month.\nLOOMING EL NINO\nAnd now the department and the Nairobi County officials have warned of possible heavy rains during the short rains, thanks to a looming El Nino episode.\nA statement by the Director of Kenya Meteorological Services, Mr James Kongoti, warned that the rains, which are likely to begin in October and end in November or December, will be the worst in 40 years. He added that the signs of the El Nino phenomenon start showing in April or May.\nIn addition, a US advisory indicates that chances of the rains continuing to the end of 2015 are above 80 per cent.\nTo mitigate the effects of the expected rains, the Nairobi County government has warned residents and asked those living near riverbanks and in low-lying areas to move to higher ground.\nElNino is a phenomenon that occurs when sea surface temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual. It occurs when the waters off the coast of Peru warm up, leading to changes in weather patterns around the world.\nFor the past year, scientists have been observing an important swathe of the Pacific Ocean, just along the equator. When conditions here are just right, an El Nino can form and wreak havoc on weather patterns across the globe.\nAware of this possibility, several countries around the world have warned their citizens of an impending \"Godzilla El Nino\", as it might be the worst ever in half a century.\nThis year, forecasters observed sea surface temperatures of more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above average across the east central Pacific Ocean.\nSuch temperatures have been recorded only three times in the past 65 years, and all three were matched with strong El Nino episodes.\n\"Despite the phenomenon taking place very far from Kenya, it influences the circulation systems in the tropical belt and hence Kenya's rainfall patterns, especially during the \"short rains\" (October to December), which tend to be enhanced,\" Mr Kingoti said.\n\"The influence is, however, not a one-to-one relationship because other factors that impact on the rainfall patterns also play a role. In other words, the fact that an El Nino occurs does not always give rise to intense rainfall,\" he added.\nMr Kingoti, who is also the country's permanent representative to the World Meteorological Organisation, further noted that enhanced or intense rainfall does not always mean that the occurrence of an El Nino episode.\nEl Nino conditions have been evolving in the equatorial Pacific Ocean since May, and the current projections using global models indicate a high possibility (90 per cent) that the evolving El Nino conditions will continue through to the \"short rains\" and mature in December as usual.\n\"The models also depict an 80 per cent chance that the conditions will last into early 2016.\nGenerally, however, the proper direction of the evolving conditions will become clearer in August,\" Mr Kingoti said.\nHe, however, pointed out that not all El Nino episodes result in the type of heavy rainfall experienced in the country in 1997/98, which many Kenyans can still vividly recall.\n\"It is important to note that there were subsequent El Nino events in 2002/03, 2006/07 and 2009/10 which went unnoticed by many people\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the Deputy Director of the Kenya Meteorological Department, Mr Peter Ambenje, said meteorological experts were still studying other factors that are likely to affect the outcome of the global prediction.\n\"We will issue a comprehensive forecast on September 2, after taking into account all the factors we are studying\" he said.\nMr Ambenje said Kenya could not rely on international forecasts because of environmental and geographical factors and indicators.\nHe said that, while what eventually happens depends on the changes being observed in the Pacific Ocean, it was not possible to predict with certainty what exactly will happen within six months because of climate change.\nIn instances where El Nino episodes lead to increased rainfall, cities are more likely to experience higher and more destructive rainfall and storms because average temperatures in a city is, typically, slightly higher than in the surrounding areas. This is known as urban heat island.\nSHRINKING INTERVALS\n\"High rainfall during El Nino periods would in the past recur after seven to 10 years but with time, and again due to climate change, the intervals are shrinking,\" Mr Ambenje said.\nSo, what happens in the event that the 2015 El Nino causes the expected heavy rainfall ?\nIt is estimated that the 1997-1998 El Nino, which is regarded as the worst ever seen in Kenya, caused the deaths of more than 300 people.\nAnd government estimates place the damage to roads and bridges caused by the rains at Sh6.7 billion. Indeed, the transportation of goods and services in the country was paralysed for several days.\nThere were landslides, especially in parts of the Rift Valley and Central provinces, leading to the loss of lives, deaths of livestock and the government spending considerable resources on rescue operations.\n\"In the event that the phenomenon is experienced again, the situation might be worse this time because of poor drainage in urban centres, especially in Nairobi and Mombasa. The drains are clogged with polythene,\" Mr Samuel Nyandemo, an economist and lecturer at the University of Nairobi's School of Economics, said.\nHe said transport is likely to be affected, inconveniencing road users and affecting the transportation of goods and services, as well as docking facilities.\n\"The country will also spend a lot of money treating diseases like malaria, dysentery and cholera, as well as in providing preventive services to reduce the number of those who fall ill. Hospital beds will be full, which means more resources will be spent on health,\" Prof Nyandemo said.\nIn the 1997-1998 El Nino, the government spent Sh900 million on water treatment and repairing damaged water supply facilities.\nThe total losses in the agricultural sector were estimated at Sh2.36 billion, with the number of livestock lost standing at 1,000,000 goats; 170,000 cattle; and 800,000 sheep.\n\"However, the government can avert the disasters by harvesting the unusually high volumes of water and using it for the country's economic good.\n\"It is time to unclog drains so that the water can be harvested and used for irrigation, electricity generation and also stored for other uses, since as we know, a dry spell might follow in February, March and April, Prof Nyandemo said.\n\"There is also a need for the government to encourage farmers, through agricultural extension officers, to plant crops that take a short time to mature so that they can be harvested before the onset of the rains.\nIf the normal crops are planted now, they will be destroyed in the farms and there will be hunger next year,\" he said.\nHe also suggested that the government provide facilities for farmers to store grains like maize, beans, wheat and rice on time to reduce the amounts that might be destroyed in case there is flooding.\nEnvironment and climate advocate and writer, Ms Cindy Musyoki, says on her blog that the country needs to adapt appropriately to the problem by instituting preventive and responsive measures.\nShe says that Nairobi is prone to flash floods due to poor planning and overcrowding, which has put pressure on land, leading to buildings being constructed in wetlands. This has been aggravated and poor waste management, which has clogged drains.\nUnfortunately, experience shows that such warnings are never taken seriously, and it is only after disaster has struck that the authorities rush to mitigate the effects.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University in the US have warned that a malaria outbreak is likely in Kenya because of the wetter and warmer weather.\n\"It will be important to monitor rainfall and the associated flooding and minimum temperatures, given their impact on malaria outbreaks,\" says an alert by WHO.\nAnd even though the Kenyan situation cannot be predicted accurately, like Mr Ambenje said, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite images show a departure from average sea-surface height over a given time of the year that correlates with warmth in the upper ocean.\nNASA says that the other thing to watch is that the El Nino could also make 2015 or 2016 the hottest year on record.\nIf that happens, then the possibility of it being followed by drought is very real, so we will once again be bombarded with images of malnourished children and dying people on our screens as the government pleads for assistance from well wishers.\nAs we continue releasing more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we are trapping more and more heat on the Earth's surface. However more than 90 per cent of this extra heat is absorbed by the oceans.\nThe interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere can make a big difference in surface temperatures.\nThese changes in the atmosphere, to which we contribute, lead to changes in weather patterns and such climatic phenomena as El Nino and La Nina.\nLa Nina occurs when there is extensive cooling of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, often accompanied by warmer-than-normal sea-surface temperatures in the western Pacific, and to the north of Australia.\nThe deadly heat waves in India and Pakistan, widespread drought in Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, and planned water rationing in Thailand are all effects of climate change.",

        "text": "At last, it seems as if the rainy season is finally coming to an end, or so hope those who live in Nairobi and its environs, because the rains have been a nightmare.\nAs the last drops fall, it is time to take stock and reflect on some of the lessons we can draw from the floods that have wreaked havoc in our roads and homes.\nYou guessed where I am heading with this: to relationships, which are sometimes besieged by heavy rains and storms. What are some of the lessons that we can learn from the rains?\nA standard line in relationship counselling is that challenges are part of the bargain, a normal part of the relationship experience.\nWith this in mind, the couple is prepared for the challenges that set in after marriage, giving them the ability to weather the early storms without too much disruption.\nNEW LEAKS\nBut like this rainy season (and some past episodes such as the infamous el-nino), sometimes the challenges overshoot the predictions by a long stretch. This might leave some relationships badly damaged and some shattered, with no chance of recovery.\nJust like the weatherman's prediction is sometimes inaccurate, it is not possible to predict the level or type of challenges that you might encounter in your relationship. So here is the lesson: expect challenges in your relationship, and just in case they seem more daunting than you anticipated, note that that too is part of it. As an enlightened person once said, if it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger.\nOne of the mistakes couples make is to assume that since there were no leaks during the last rainy season, there will be none during the present season. The reality, however, is that any structure that is exposed to the elements is likely to suffer some depreciation, and leaks might appear in the least expected places, places you thought were tightly sealed.\nLikewise, relationships are constantly exposed to the various elements of life.\nIn many cases, complacency might creep in after people have been together for a while, forgetting that \"new\" leaks might appear in our relationships even when we think we are in a good place.\nWhen this happens, we can easily fail to recognise the first drops of conflict, which are the forerunners of a perilous storm.\nIn practical terms, it means that as partners, we should maintain a constant, as well as a 'live' connection with each other to make it possible to identify new challenges and deal with them.\nWISE COUPLES\nAnother important lesson to bear in mind is that the rains don't usually come in torrents during the start of the rainy season.\nA wise couple does not wait for the rain to start pounding, rather, they confront the challenge before it gets full-blown and therefore unmanageable, leaving destruction in its wake.\nLearning to identify the first drops of an approaching storm is a critical skill in resolving conflict. I once heard a man say that if his wife serves him food without looking at him, he does not eat until he finds out the reason for her reaction. His reasoning is that by taking the opportunity to resolve minor issues, he forestalls the possibility of a destructive storm.\nLesson: learn to act when the first drops fall, identify the likely challenges and deal with them then, before the storm comes and finds you unprepared.\nWell, the rainy season might be coming to an end, but as sure as day and night, it will come again.\nEven as you enjoy the sunshine, remember that when the rains come by once again, the challenges might be more than anticipated, new challenges might crop up, but acting while the rain drops are still gentle might save us a life time of pain and regret.",

        "text": "For two consecutive nights in the middle of May the rains pounded Nairobi.\nFloodwaters rendered homes unliveable, ruined cars and kept vexed, exhausted commuters on the road until early morning. Schoolchildren were trapped in a school bus, and at least ten people died.\nThe Meteorological Department acknowledged that this downpour was unusually heavy and varying amounts of rainfall had fallen in different parts of the city.\n\"Our station here in Dagoretti Corner recorded up to 189mm for the two days. That's very, very heavy because it's even more than the long-term average for the whole month of May,\" said Mr Samuel Mwangi, the Deputy Director of the Kenya Meteorological Department Thursday. \"Wilson Airport recorded more than 120mm for the two days.\"\nThese were normal long rains which happen from March to May, he explained, not caused by El Nino.\n\"We can't say this has anything to do with the global phenomenon because indeed El Nino has very little relationship with the long rains in Eastern Africa and Kenya for that matter.\"\nSo, how does the recent flooding episode fit in the bigger climate picture?\n1) 2015 is an El Nino year\nMr Mwangi made those remarks a day before a US advisory placed chances of El Nino continuing to the end of 2015 at greater than 80 per cent. Australian scientists were also predicting a strong event.\n\"This will be quite a substantial event. It's not a weak one or a near miss,\" David Jones of Australia's Bureau of Meteorology told the Sydney Morning Herald.\nEl Nino is caused when the waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru warm, leading to changes in weather patterns around the world. In East Africa it causes heavy rains during the short rains from October to December, with little influence on the long rains that occur from March to May. The recent storm was destructive, but there could be a worse one ahead.\nChart of abnormal ocean surface temperatures [C] observed in December 1997 during the last strong El Nino. Note the high temperature around the coast of Peru (source: National Centers for Environmental Prediction, US).\n2) El Nino doesn't always mean more rain\nThe onset of an El Nino event in the Pacific Ocean does not necessarily result in increased rainfall for East Africa, according to a Kenyan climate expert. Professor Nzioka Muthama of the University of Nairobi explained that an El Nino event goes through the stages of onset, growth and maturity.\n\"The El Nino may set on but not grow, or decay before it matures,\" he said. If El Nino's effects were felt in Kenya, not every town would necessarily receive high rainfall.\" He also cautioned that due to many uncertainties, it was impossible to predict what would happen six months in advance with good confidence, although a clear rainfall prediction for Kenya was possible from around August.\n3) Cities are susceptible\nThe average temperature in a city is slightly higher than in surrounding areas. This feature, called an urban heat island, can increase the likelihood of storms.\n\"These buildings not only generate heat, but also capture solar radiation, such that in a built-up area the temperatures are slightly higher than the surroundings.\n\"Now when this interacts with the atmospheric variables, humidity and so on, it can sometimes enhance convection, and sometimes you see that urban areas sometimes tend to experience some severe storms,\" said Mr. Mwangi\nClouds gather above the Nairobi city skyline on May 14, 2015. The average temperature in a city is slightly higher than in surrounding areas. PHOTO | JEFF ANGOTE | NATION\nUrban areas are also less permeable to water. \"In urban areas there is a lot of pavement, tarmac, and buildings. All these prevent water from seeping into the ground and therefore water tends to collect a lot on the surface,\" Mr Mwangi explains. \"Buildings and walls inhibit the natural flow of water, making flooding more serious than it would otherwise be\".\n4) El Nino and La Nina have been costly\nThe 1997-1998 El Nino which is still regarded as the strongest event yet, was particularly destructive:\nIt was estimated that 300 people died from drowning, according to a UN report.\nThe estimated cost to roads and bridges was $670 million. Docking facilities were submerged in floodwaters and offloading cargo from ships was impossible as a result. Other losses included widespread landslides, soil erosion and breakage of small dams.\n$8.9 million was spent on chemicals for water treatment and repair of water supply facilities damaged during El Nino.\nTotal losses in the agricultural sector were estimated at $236 million, There was massive loss of livestock, with 1,000,000 goats, 170,000 cattle and 800,000 sheep lost. Total livestock losses were valued at more than $113,000,000.\nA photo in the Daily Nation on January 27, 1998 shows an oil tanker negotiating what remained of Kambu Bridge, Mombasa, after it was swept away by floods. The estimated cost to roads and bridges damaged by the El Nino rains was $670 million. PHOTO | NATION ARCHIVES\n5) El Nino means rain. La Nina means drought\nEl Nino and La Nina are the warm and cold phases of the same phenomenon, the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). While El Nino is caused by warming of waters in the eastern Pacific, La Nina is caused by cooling of waters in the same part of the world. In East Africa, La Nina usually leads to drought during the 'short rains' season.\nSince Kenya's independence in 1963, two especially strong El Nino events have been recorded, in 1982 and 1997.

The entire floor downstairs was full of water that destroyed almost everything, including electronic equipment, furniture and clothes,\" Ms Dorothy Rautta, a resident of the NHC Nairobi West Estate lamented.\nHer neighbour, Ms Joan Ayaga, was lost for words after she found her Mercedes Benz car underwater after the heavy rains that pounded the city from 6.45pm and continued late into the night.\nSince a similar downpour had been experienced the previous day, the Nairobi River channel that was built many years ago to block parts of waterways to allow the construction of buildings, could not hold.\nIt is these waters that caused the widespread destruction. Kenya Power Nairobi West Sub-Station was also flooded.\nAt Nyayo Highrise, the Nairobi River broke the walls that the contractor building the channel had erected to prevent water from flowing into the estate. The estate, residents said, is built on a river valley.\n\"We witnessed similar problem of flooding during the 1997 El Nino, but this time it is worse, especially for people in the lower section of the estate who did not sleep since their houses were covered with water,\" a resident, Josephat Rumitu told the Nation.\nDeputy director in charge of forecasting at Kenya Meteorological Department Peter Ambenje said they had given out a warning on Sunday that Nairobi was likely to receive over 50 millilitres of rain in 24 hours this week.\nThe rains have inconvenienced both motorists and travellers who spent hours in gridlocks on Tuesday.\n\"I spent six hours between Lenana School along Ngong Road and Dagoretti Corner,\" a motorist, David Muniu, said noting that what caused the traffic jam was overlapping of vehicles from both sides.\nAnd they did this because police were absent. \"We left the CBD at 8pm and reached Dagoretti Corner at 3:30am,\" a Kenya Bus said.\nMr Muniu said matatu touts rescued the situation after making efforts to decongest the traffic. Criminals however used the chance to harass motorists and passengers, especially women in the absence of the police.\nThose using Lang'ata Road and Mombasa Road recounted harrowing experiences. \"I got home in Ongata Rongai at 3:30am after leaving the city at 8pm,\" a journalist said.\nYesterday, Dr Kidero apologised to residents saying the amount of rainfall experienced in the last few days was unprecedented.\nAt the same time, the Nairobi county government has set up a Sh50 million emergency recovery fund.\nAccording to the executive for Transport Mohamed Abdullah, the cash is being used largely to clear clogged drainage channels and to repair roads that have been destroyed by the rains.\n\"This is a short-term measure and we will be constantly monitoring the implementation of these plans by our field teams,\" Mr Abdullahi said in a statement.",

        "text": "For some time now, the meteorological department has been warning of impeding El Nino rains that are expected to pound the country in the month of October and could last for a month.\nIn parts of the country, the signs are already evident; rains and gathering clouds.\nThe last El Nino phenomenon to hit the country was experienced in the period 1997/1998.\nThe extent of the damage caused by those torrential rains at that time was gargantuan.\nHouses, power lines, crops, livestock and roads were swept away.\nSeveral deaths were also reported where flood water overwhelmed people.\nIn an effort to preclude a repeat of the same, Deputy President William Ruto chaired a Cabinet meeting recently whose aim was to come up with a strategy to mitigate the ravages of the expected heavy rains.\nAt the meeting, it was resolved that Sh5 billion be set aside for exigencies. The Government also put 70,000 National Youth Service members on standby; to be called upon to offer assistance during emergencies as they may arise.\nCounty governments have also been called upon to chip in and enhance their disaster preparedness, but given their financial constraints, they may not be of much help.\nThe haphazard manner of planning in most urban centres like Nairobi and towns like Narok may render these measures futile for various reasons. Poorly constructed houses are known to come crumbling down during heavy rains. In Nairobi, cases of buildings collapsing have been on the increase lately. The City County Government, and others where extensive damage is likely to occur, must, in the intervening period, ensure dangerous buildings are brought down or evacuated to minimise casualties.\nAll structures and buildings on natural waterways and riparian land must be demolished for the simple reason that when water can't find its level, it will stray into homesteads, with disastrous effects. Noble efforts that were put in place to beautify Nairobi and clear the drainage system at around the time President Obama came to Kenya in July should be stepped up.\nFor many years, Budalang'i and Nyando plains have borne the brunt of floods because residents not only lose property, livestock and crops, they lose lives as well. There have been attempts to build dykes along the Nzoia and Nyando rivers, which burst their banks and cause destruction in these areas, but they might not be effective against El Nino flooding.\nEither the dykes must be reinforced and increased or the county governments in these areas must make arrangements to move families to higher grounds. Similar efforts must be taken in landslide-prone areas of the Rift Valley and Central Kenya.\nPeople don't always give their own safety priority and it would be a lesser evil to forcibly evacuate them to safety if need arises than count deaths from floods and landslides.\nBad weather has meant poor maize yields in the food basket of the Rift Valley. Should El Nino come and destroy the remaining crop and disrupt farming, are there concrete measures to ensure food security for millions of Kenyan households? We cannot lose sight of the fact that a few months ago, at least 1.6 million Kenyans faced starvation.\nThe Ministry of Health must also make arrangements to contain possible outbreaks of water-borne diseases, especially cholera, which has assailed parts of the country in the recent past.\nIn all, preparations for the worst case scenario must be made even as the Government endeavours to sensitise the public on what to expect and how to maintain safety.",

More than 300,000 children under five are acutely malnourished, 56,000 of whom face death if not treated.\nAppealing for $885 million in aid, Peter de Clerq, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, said agencies aimed to reduce the number of people requiring food aid to 3.2 million from 4.9 million and cut malnutrition rates.\nSomalia has been mired in conflict since civil war broke out in 1991. Islamist militant group al Shabaab has waged a decade-long insurgency against the Somali government, which is supported by African Union troops.\nFighting, combined with attacks on aid workers and a history of aid being manipulated for political gain, means Somalia is one of the toughest countries for relief agencies to operate in.\nFamine in 2011 - caused by failed rains, conflict and a ban on food aid deliveries to territory held by al Shabaab - killed some 260,000 people.\nBut aid agencies expect better functioning markets and improved security in some areas this year will help to end hunger for hundreds of thousands of Somalis.\n\"With adequate support, we can reduce deaths,\" de Clerq said in a statement.\nHumanitarian demands have also been stretched by the arrival of 30,000 Somalis who were refugees in neighbouring Kenya and Yemen, as well as Yemeni refugees fleeing war in their country.\nIn addition, some 145,000 people have been hit in recent months by the El Nino weather phenomenon which triggered flooding and droughts across Somalia, the U.N. said.\nThe African Union peacekeeping force working with Somalia's military has made significant gains against al Shabaab in recent years, pushing the militants out of strategic towns in south-central Somalia.\nThey still control some rural areas and frequently launch attacks. On Sunday, al Shabaab said it had killed more than 100 Kenyan soldiers, who are part of the African Union force, during an attack on military bases. Kenya did not confirm the casualties.\nMore than one million Somalis are internally displaced while another one million are hosted as refugees in neighbouring countries.",

Residents of Kapcherop, Chebororwa and Kipsaya in Marakwet West Sub County were also asked to move.\nHowever one of the residents, Joseph Kibet of Kabechei in Keiyo South, said relocation was not practical unless they were resettled in safer areas and their land parcels swapped with other plots and used for conservation of wildlife and plants.\n\"During the 1997 El Nino rains, people, livestock and other property were swept down the escarpment by massive landslides. But we have not been resettled in safer areas as promised,\" Kibet said.\nBy last week, the Government was busy mobilising resources in anticipation that there will be heavy floods and announced that it had raised Sh12 billion to meet the cost of repairs of the destruction it anticipates will be associated with the El Nino rains.\nWork has began on the reconstruction and strengthening of dykes, unclogging of canals and desilting of dams and water pans across the country even before the rains begin.\nLast week, Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa (pictured below) visited Nyando, Kano Plains and Budalang'i to assess the situation and launched the repairing of dykes and removal of silt and mud at the mouths of rivers Nzoia and Nyando along Lake Victoria.\n\"We already have Sh12 billion from the national and county governments out of the Sh18 billion that we estimate is required to deal with the problem,\" said Wamalwa.\nThe county governments have released a combined budget of Sh7 billion while the national government has raised Sh5 billion. The deficit has been pledged by development partners and the private sector.\nAll El Nino programmes are to be undertaken by a multi-sectoral task force involving the ministries of Water, Education, Devolution and Special Programmes, Defence, Health, Agriculture and Interior.\nKenyans are being sensitised on how to deal with the floods and landslides that could accompany the heavy rains which are expected to start any time now. Emergency teams from the National Youth Service will help to harvest excess water, repair damaged roads and infrastructure, and control floods.\nThe Government is also desilting dams and water pans to store large amounts of running water and prevent damage to property.\nThis past week, Wamalwa led a team of senior government officers to Laikipia and Nyandarua where they inspected 52 dams built by the colonial government that are ready for desilting. In Marsabit, they found Bakuli Dam full of sand and logs.\n\"We will deploy the military and NYS to clear those dams so that we can store as much water as possible and also to ensure that people are safe,\" said the CS.\nThe Ministry of Devolution has promised to release 70,000 men and women from NYS to help in the El Nino control activities around the country while the Ministry of Defence will also provide personnel and equipment to excavate the dams and repair roads.",

And no, it is not how much we are paying for the 22 MPs and seven senators' visit to the nine-day Assembly of State Parties meeting in The Hague.\nAllow me to digress for a minute. Isn't it just a few days ago that Treasury banned non-essential foreign trips due to the much-publicised cash crunch? In what realm does having an entourage of 29 individuals constitute necessity or a constructive use of taxpayers' Sh100 million? Are all 29 going to be presenting an agenda to the Assembly?\nThis is not a lobby event where the tyranny of numbers dictates the support you can buy, it is an international event where you present your case, are heard and await the verdict. Clearly, the travel sanction only applies to certain echelons of public officials, or more likely, it was the usual rhetoric that we are used to.\nAnyway, back to our Sh700 million worth of woes. A few years ago, the monetary value of Nairobi traffic was calculated and estimated at a whooping Sh60 million per day. Well, this past week a combination of El Nino and other factors that make no logical sense culminated in motorists spending hours and hours on end sitting in their cars on a Saturday.\nThe one day that the absence of school runs, rigorous work schedules and rush hour should have made relatively easier to traverse the city, found us stewing in humidity, sitting ducks for traffic-related mischief makers.\nA journey that takes me 17 minutes on a normal day, took me over one-and-a-half hours.\nOther people who were more unfortunate took over two hours just to cover a stretch of a few kilometres. This state of affairs persisted for the whole day, causing a great deal of frustration with explanations that just did not warrant the kind of backlog that we experienced.\nThere is something to be said though, for technology. Amidst the frustration and frayed nerves, the now renowned mobile application, 'ma3route' that works via Twitter was truly invaluable.\nAs an information sharing platform, it enabled people to anticipate where the bottlenecks were (which to be frank in some instances was everywhere) and allow us to make a choice between sitting in traffic, taking an alternative route and cancelling our errands altogether.\nWhat plausible reason was given for this atrocious traffic? The closure of one road apparently for repairs or some such thing that caused a backlog for hours on end.\nFurther afield, more than 1,500 trucks, buses and cars were, by Saturday, stuck on a 30-mile stretch on Mombasa Road for the fourth consecutive day.\nStranded without any nourishment and in some cases with children, travellers were at their wits' end, victims of a city that grows beyond its capacity and city planners who are all hot air with no real problem-solving techniques.\nApparently, the scenario was exacerbated by the recent rains and ongoing road repairs. But the real reason is an incessant lack of planning and foresight from city officials and an inability (or refusal) to think past the actions into the ripple effects and consequences of what are not isolated actions.\nIt may be too much to expect any foresight from city planners and developers given that the fiasco that accompanied the overvalued, amateur move to use drums to control traffic a few months ago, a stellar show of ineptitude from the Governor's office, truly went belly-up.\nEven though we usually joke that one day the whole city will come to a traffic standstill, this weekend was neither funny nor fun, not for the people who were stuck or the colossal amount of money that was wasted in lost productivity.",

(Photo:File/Standard)\nThe government has set in motion measures to deal with the impending El Nino rains. Among the measures include tasking respective ministries to deal with whatever falls within their domains and asking county governments to do their part.\nThe Government warned Kenyans residing in flood and mudslide prone areas that they will be moved to safer grounds in case of the rains.\nMr. Ruto said: \"It is imperative to prepare the country well to minimize the destruction that accompany the rains. The signs are on and the tempo is gathering and we must be prepared as a people to counter these effects.\"\nAnd added: \"We want detailed information on counties that face the risk of floods so that we can put in place evacuation plans if needed. We must have a national plan with areas that are vulnerable and that need immediate action.\"\nThis was arrived at during a cabinet committee on disaster preparedness chaired by Deputy President William Ruto.\nMr. Ruto said legislative arms of both national and county governments may be asked to adjust their budgets to meet intervention measures in case of the rains.\nMr. Ruto said, \"Given the anticipated scale of the disaster and necessary intervention the national and county governments need to adjust and realign budgets accordingly in order for the country to respond appropriately.\"\nThe meeting formed a technical team under the Ministry of Interior to work out a coherent workable plan with measures to be undertaken in specific counties to lessen the adverse effects of the anticipated floods.\nAt the same time, Mr. Ruto advised maize farmers whose crop is still in the field to harvest it noting that the country risked loosing 40 % of the crop in the El Nino rains if not harvested now.\nHe said, \"We are asking the county governments under the instruction of the ministry of Agriculture to teach farmers on the best methods of drying their crop including providing the maize farmers with mobile driers.\"\nAnd added \"In others counties that are usually rain deficient, we are asking the county governments to invest in the provision of seed and fertilizer to the farmers to take advantage of the El Nino to grow crops with a anticipated bumper harvest.\"\nThe meeting also tasked the ministry of education to ensure that pupils are safe during the rains while that of infrastructure was asked to make roads passable.\nCabinet secretary for national treasury Henry Rotich advised the county governments to have a contingency fund saying the shs. 5 billion contingency fund at the treasury would support what the counties were already doing to ameliorate the situation.\nCabinet Secretary for Devolution Anne Waiguru said the National Youth Service has 70,000 NYS personnel station stationed around the country to help in mitigating the effects of the floods.",

That is what will be left of the country after thieving cartels have stripped off our heritage in some elaborate scam that will force this government to declare Kenya bankrupt.\nThe sacred Mugumo tree has fallen and that can only mean that change is in the offing. The same happened before independence and the colonialists had to hand over power to Kenyatta. In the run up to the 2012 General Election, another Mugumo tree fell and with it the old guard of the Kibaki generation had to hand over to Kamwana and arap Samoei. Now that the sacred tree has been uprooted by unseen hands on a calm day, it means an overhaul of alliances is about to happen.\nThe time is up for leaders who plot to gag the media from reporting sleaze and dishonourable conduct in the House. This is after sponsoring a Bill to award a generous pension to election losers so that they can maintain their illegitimate lifestyle when they can no longer claim false mileage and are not liable for those obscene sitting allowances.\nAfter the more than Sh100,000 wheelbarrows fiasco in Bungoma County alongside the golden gates of Nyamira and Meru County's Sh8 million curtains, the government is proposing Sh37,500 bar soap to be distributed to Kenyans who will be affected by El Nino. The Pope had better get here fast.\nOtherwise by the time the pontiff shows up, the National Disaster Operations Centre, prompted by the weatherman's prediction will leave the government with no other option but to borrow from Mshwari after exhausting all other avenues of lending.\nThis should not come as a surprise as the country runs on Mpesa according to local adverts. Meanwhile, credible reports indicate that whereas authorities are trying their best to mitigate against the phenomena that turns the entire country into Budalang'i, the citizens are doing their best to stock up for the rainy season. It goes without saying that when heavens finally open, accessing shops for these basic necessities will not be an easy task. Therefore forewarned is forearmed.\nBut the tragedy would be failing to cash in on El Nino. With many in administration squandering resources in the name of El Nino, it is a wonder sponsors are yet to activate their lobbyists to protest poor weather predictions and its subsequent wasted budgeting. Meaning all those stealing in the name of El Nino may just get away with it. It is prospects like this that makes some of us to demand action. Why mwananchi should be left out of the disaster fund bandwagon could be the real tragedy. If there is fairness in this land, we should be allowed a piece of the action.\nSince all the sabuni (soap) and sanitary towels to be distributed to Kenyans affected by El Nino has been budgeted for, I propose a tender be awarded to supply umbrella, gumboots and raincoats to all the tots who never got the laptops they were promised by the government.\nAnd after supplying them at a price that will be inclusive of VAT, I too will remember the El Nino with fond memories like the rest of the busybodies in this country mitigating the disaster using taxpayers money. And ladies will require non carcinogenic weaves that don't drench in the rains. Someone else could supply that too. El Nino might just determine the future of leadership in this country, the Mugumo is never wrong.",

Out of these, 500,000 are expected to be displaced from their homes by the floods and land slides.\nCounties in North Eastern (Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit and Garissa), South Eastern (Kitui, Makueni, Machakos) and along the Coast (Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale, Tana River and Taita Taveta) are expected to experience flooding. Others include historically flood prone areas like Kano plains, Budalang'i and the Tana delta.\nMurang'a, Nyeri, Meru and the Rift Valley escarpment were identified as counties that are likely to experience landslides.\nThe team gave the report to a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by Deputy President William Ruto, in which they said funds were expected to be used to buy food, medicine, tents, transport and to relocate those affected. Part of the money would also be used in repairing roads and schools in case they were ruined by the rains.\nRuto recommended that the money be sourced within ministries. \"Let us use the structures that are already in existence so that we can save costs. We already have the structures and facilities, so let's find ways of using them,\" said Ruto.\nThe team presented the report during a meeting that was attended by Cabinet secretaries Eugene Wamalwa (Water) and Judy Wakhungu (Environment), principal secretaries David Lesiyampe (Environment) and Mwanamaka Mabruki (Devolution) among other Government and county officials.\nIn the meeting, it was resolved that Government officials who perform emergency functions should not be paid allowances for what they do.\nSince the El Nino rains are expected to start anytime from next week, Education ministry officials said they will airlift national examinations in case the rains made roads impassable. The examinations are set to begin in mid-October.\nThe United Nations Children's Fund, World Health Organisation and mobile provider Safaricom are among organisations that have come on board to help the Government ensure preparedness.",

Sadly, this scene is replicated many times in the area.\nKenya Red Cross records indicate that 8,086 households or 43,184 people have been displaced from their homes in Tana River County after River Tana burst its banks last week due to the heavy rains pounding upstream regions.\nThe humanitarian body says there are 40 camps for the internally displaced people in the region, and there is a dire need for relief food and medical supplies. Most of the camps are in mosquito infested bushy areas of the county.\nDeplorable conditions\nLocal community organisations estimate that about 25,000 of the displaced are children.\nA local community health nurse, Zacharia Maru, says most children are at risk of communicable diseases such as cholera, typhoid and other illnesses like malaria as a result of the deplorable living conditions.\n\"We have diagnosed some of them with malaria and pneumonia, but given that there are no toilets and clean drinking water, we are afraid that a waterborne disease could break out in the camps,\" says Maru who runs a private clinic in Haluva.\nThe shortage of medical facilities in the area makes the situation even more perilous.\n\"My son has been ailing for the last three days, but I have no money to take him to hospital.\n\"The only medical officials who have visited us since we arrived here three weeks ago are those administering the polio vaccine,\" says Badilisha.\nThe young mother is pregnant and is worried about her unborn child. She says they are yet to receive help from the county and national governments.\nThe children lying next to her son - Lucy Eziel (six), Olive Dambale (12), Adeline Dambala (ten), Shahb Babo (15) and Ken Gudini - have not received medical assistance either.\n\"We are desperate and don't know what to do or who to run to because the children are becoming weaker every day,\" says Jillo Daido, a father with a sick child at Haluba A camp.\nOther camps across the Tana Delta include Kitere (which has 218 households displaced from Garsen West); Miyesa Camp with 175 households from Garsen Central; Korlabe A, B and C; Vumbwe; Madogo and Masabubu.",

        "text": "The Kenya flower sector is on blue standby as el Nino rains start pounding parts of the country as growers get ready to tackle the numerous challenges associated with flooding, cloudy, cold and wet weather.\n\"We are expecting higher concentrations of disease, subdued production, disruption of transport and marooning of employees requiring we plan for emergency evacuations\", said Oserian Development Company administration director Kirimi Mpungu.\nThe effects could spill over to the industry's most important annual flower sales season, Valentine's Day due to interruption of production cycles by the chilly weather, which inhibits productivity, he added.\nThe Kenya Flower Council Chief Executive Officer, Jane Ngige, says the phenomenon will dampen the fortunes of flower exports that had began blooming going by last year's performance when Sh 56 billion in foreign exchange was earned, compared with Sh 45 billion the year earlier. Volumes stood at 130,000 tons, the first increase in five years, Mrs Ngige said.\nKey concerns include diseases such as downy mildew, powdery mildew and botrytis that develop rapidly in wet, cloudy, cold weather. Farms have stocked up on agrochemicals due to anticipated increased sprays, repaired pumps and purchased new ones.\n\"We are not leaving anything to chance\", said Mr Mpungu.\nHe added that the farm has cleared drainage trenches and is ready to pump out water if need arises. In addition, all leave has been suspended to have all hands on deck.\nNaivasha growers have formed a security committee with regional security officers to ensure that emergency responses at the farms and residential areas are on standby. \"There could be need to rescue workers if residential areas get flooded\", Mr Mpungu added.\nEmergencies could include falling of trees and power lines creating the danger of electrocution therefore, all danger points have been marked for action, he added.\nThe farm has also placed sandbags to redirect flood water and debris away from the farm, while the health center staff is on high alert in case of emergencies associated with flooding such as cholera, diarrhea, typhoid and malaria. \"Our first aid kits are not only fully stocked but extra requirements added to avoid running out of products when needed most\", said Mr Mpungu.\nFor starters, flowers need optimum sunlight and heat for key growth activities like photosynthesis. Again when it is cold, flowers tend to shrink and curl as they seek to conserve energy. Such dormant growth process is likely to slow production and maturity of flowers, a factor that the industry worries may slow sales volumes during Valentine's season. Oserian however isn't sleeping on its laurels and intends to ensure normal flower growing conditions are set in place. It has introduced artificial light and heat to maintain the required light and temperatures to keep the flowers growing.",

The Nairobi- Mombasa highway was cut off at Taru and road users forced to endure more than 48 hours stuck in traffic. Remember how depressed you become when your car is caught in a traffic jam for 30 minutes? Then think of spending two solid days in traffic. Even worse, in Ruai Camp for the internally displaced persons, raging waters swept structures re-displacing many people. In Taita Tavita, a four-year old child who was playing with his mates ran into a quarry and drowned. These are just a few cases. Kenyans are at risk.\nThe Meteorological department says the rains will go on for a relatively longer time. So chances are there will be more deaths, more displacements and more destruction of property and crops. In the wake of persistent warnings by the Kenya Meoteorological Services (KMS), the Deputy President chaired two strategic meetings on the 8th and 25th of November with other stakeholders. A meeting in which it was passed that the national government would allocate Sh5 billion and county governments Sh7 million as part of the El Nino disaster preparedness fund.\nAs is peculiarly Kenyan, crazy allocations did not miss out. Sh30 million was allocated for the transportation of KCSE and KCPE examination materials, another Sh30 million to investigate and confirm disease outbreaks, and craziest of all, Sh37,500 per bar soap to mention a few. The big question now is where did El Nino money go?\nWhen people are dying and others getting displaced, when heavy down pour causes traffic snarl ups, when IDPs are getting re-dispaced and the government is looking away, what is the explanation?\nWith the hot air that symptomised the El Nino mitigation strategies, everyone might have thought that people living in flood prone areas would be resettled before the rains, that bridges would be constructed, that rescue teams would be dispatched across the country to help victims and that very few (if any) lives would be lost.\nReports indicate that Narok, Siaya, Kisumu, Migori, Nakuru, Murang'a, Bomet and Tharaka Nithi are some of the counties greatly affected. Those are not names of places in Wonderland. They are counties in Kenya. The same Kenya whose Deputy President is William Ruto who said verbatim, \"Our aim is to avoid the loss of life, minimise the destruction of property and take advantage of the rains to ensure ample supply of water and in semi-arid areas seek to utilise the rainfall for farming.\" Now Kenyans are asking: When will the government start using the El Nino money to avoid the loss of lives and minimise destruction?\nOr did some junior officers in a ministry embezzle it and the CS is yet to blow a whistle the Anne Waiguru way? Well, whatever the case might be, Kenyans demand to know. Real quick.",

        "text": "Maize Lethal Necrosis, a killer disease famous for wiping entire maize yields and first reported in Kenya in 2011, has been farmers' and the Government's biggest headache in the recent past.\nIn Bomet, where it was first reported, farmers have christened it 'Koroito' or plague, even though they can't explain its origin. When it first struck, it affected over 26,000 hectares, costing the country some Sh2 billion.\nThe disease continues to ravage some 300,000 metric tonnes of maize yield in Kenya each year, in a country whose per capita consumption of maize stands at 98 kilograms and an approximated 90 per cent of the population rely on the crop directly or indirectly.\nOn the other hand, the United Nations has classified Kenya among countries that are water-stressed, with the renewable water resources per capita being below 1,000 cubic metres, making the country water-scarce.\nThe country, according to the body, doesn't replenish its water resources, with the population consuming 33 billion cubic metres even as renewable water resources stand at 30.7 billion cubic metres, indicating a 2.7 million cubic metres shortfall. Statistics aside, what is the connection between 'Koroito' and Kenya's dismal water levels?\nBeyond the expected El Nino rains being the common denominator, it holds the answer to not just the two menaces but to dozens of problems facing a sector that is Kenya's lifeline.\nBut positive opportunities abound with the expected El Nino if we look deeper.\nTake an example of maize, which is predominantly grown by our farmers and which has currently been the victim of early harvesting as farmers try to salvage what they can ahead of the rains. But the same maize has been the target of the Necrosis disease, with farmers being advised to crop-rotate to tame the spread of the disease.\nSo now that farms won't be accommodating maize at least for as long as the rains will be here with us, farmers can take advantage of this to crop-rotate by planting crops that can withstand the heavy torrents.\nFruit trees like mangoes, avocados and passion fruits do well in such rains as well as finger millet. There is no reason to leave farms idle. And as we rush to fill our tanks and all other water storage containers, history will repeat itself months after El Nino is gone, when we retreat to chorusing about failed rains, depressed crop yields, dwindling pastures, food price spikes and episodic hunger. History has taught us that we never learn.\nLow-cost water conservation technologies like dams and underground water storage techniques have been the crown jewel of those who have taken advantage of wet seasons to cushion themselves during dry spells. Companies like Elgon Kenya have been proactive in providing modern affordable water technologies especially for the agricultural sector.\nTake the example of dam liners that store water for years while preventing seepage, or the transformative Kadogo drip kit that facilitates all-year-round food production that is not reliant on weather after farmers successfully harvest the water.\nBut even as farmers take advantage of the rains, the Government should create an enabling environment to ensure no crop goes to waste.\nMost of the produce that farmers harvest will be stored in substandard conditions that have been hurriedly prepared. This opens new grounds for a potential crisis of gargantuan proportions; the aflatoxins. But to those farmers who are quick to dispose of their maize, exploitative middlemen and traders are ready to ride on the farmers' desperation by buying produce at throw-away prices.\nInstitutions like the National Cereals and Produce Board should be replenishing their reserves by buying from farmers.",

It appears that the El Nino rains are here with us as predicted and it is time authorities stepped up mitigation measures. Several people have been killed in raging floods, dozens rendered homeless and livelihoods destroyed. Just this week, lightning struck Turkana and Trans Mara, killing several people, including an eight-year-old girl.\nSamburu, Narok, North Rift, Western, Coast, Nairobi and parts of Central have also borne the brunt of the heavy rains. The national and county governments must now act urgently to alleviate suffering among those affected by floods. A few months ago, the government announced it had set aside Sh5 billion while the county governments were allocated Sh20 million each to counter the destructive rains. The target was to raise Sh15.5 billion, including funds from the donor community.\nThe World Bank, Development Partners Group, World Food Programme, European Union and the Kenya Private Sector Alliance have offered to help raise funds for humanitarian aid. That is the way it should be.\nBesides causing deaths, heavy rains also displace families and contribute to the spread of communicable diseases. Health authorities must step up efforts to treat those who fall victim to diseases such as the Rift Valley Fever, diarrhoea and malaria.\nThe Kenya Red Cross Society has purchased two boats to help ferry Nairobi residents affected by floods. The Government has also announced that some 70,000 youths from the National Youth Service (NYS) have been put on standby to help flood victims.\nWe, therefore, urge authorities to roll out concrete plans to fix the damage wrought by the heavy rains. Already, several roads have been rendered impassable, halting transport of goods and leaving travellers stranded.\nThose in areas cut off by the floods will need urgent food aid and clean water.\nA new report released by the United Nations and the World Bank this week shows that the number of women who die while giving life globally has decreased by 44 per cent since 1990.\nThat the lives of about half the women who used to die before 1990 have been saved is commendable. The reduction in mortality is as a direct result of deliberate health interventions.\nBut even as the maternal mortality rate decreases by half, patients continue to die in hospitals in Kenya. In two recent cases in Kakamega and Kiambu counties, two patients died while waiting to receive medical attention.\nThis is unacceptable and the Ministry of Health must make good their pledge and ensure that professional negligence is punished.\nMaternal deaths from negligence are unacceptable in the 21st century, especially when we are struggling to ensure that we have an efficient healthcare system.\nStrengthening health systems, increasing the number of skilled attendants for expectant women and their newborns and expanding access to emergency reproductive health services are some of the ways of ensuring our wives, sisters and mothers live to see their offspring grow.\nThe Ministry of Health must ensure that we have these systems in place.",

If that situation happens, that is the vote that we will go for. We have also asked ministries to prepare for the phenomenon by restructuring their budgets. They all have to ensure that they are ready,\" said Rotich at Parliament Buildings.\nThe Government has also roped in county governments to make sure they use some of the money in their coffers to prepare for any emergency that is likely to arise from the extended heavy rains.\nThere is likelihood of flooding in North Eastern around Garissa, lower Tana, Kano plains in Nyanza and Budalang'i in Western Region, according to the meteorological department.\nThe Cabinet secretary told the MPs that he had already met donors and donor agencies to alert them that the situation may be dire, so they are ready to step in and mitigate if and when disaster strikes.\nLand or mudslides are likely to occur in floods-prone areas of Western region, Lower Tana, Nandi Hills and Central Kenya (Murang'a).\nThe meteorologists have also warned that heavy storms accompanied by lightning are also expected in Western Kenya especially in Kisii, Nandi and Kakamega.\nThe PAC chairman Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda) and members John Mbadi (Suba) and Timothy Bosire (Kitutu Masaba) questioned how the National Treasury had ready money for El Nino on one hand, but when it came to paying teachers, it was difficult to raise Sh1.3 billion every month to cover the Sh17 billion pay bill for the 288,000 striking teachers.\n\"You can see how tight it is for us to raise the money. We are cutting the budget to the ministries. We have gone to the donors and even the county governments. The amount that we are talking about when it comes to teachers is so huge that we have to programme it,\" said Rotich.",

        "text": "A farmer shows the destruction of his banana plantation by floods at the Tana Delta following days of heavy rains.\nTo a farmer, rain is generally a welcome blessing. Wet weather and plants are usually a match made in heaven. However, sometimes there can be too much of a good thing. Problems caused by heavy rains in different regions of the country may soon start to show up in the farms with the much anticipated El Nino rains.\nThe next few months will present unique challenges to farmers due to overabundance of rain. These include the treatable problems like leaf spot, yellowing leaves due to Nitrogen deficiency and more serious ones such as root rot and stem blight.\nLEAFY DISEASES\nMost plant diseases require moisture to infect and spread and are therefore worse during wet weather. This is especially true of the leaf spot diseases, which are easy to recognise by the circular tan, brown or purple spots they cause on the plant foliage. On ornamental plants, leaf spot diseases are typically just a cosmetic problem, though a few are more serious.\nOn vegetables, leaf spot diseases cause great concern since they often result in reduced yields. Most leaf spot diseases are specific, only capable of infecting a few species of plants. When a plant in your yard develops leaf spot, do not worry about it spreading to everything in your yard, though it will likely spread to plants of the same type (from one tomato plant to another, for example).\nPruning and spacing plants to promote good air circulation will help them dry quickly and can reduce leaf spot problems. Removing spotted leaves from plants will help slow spread of the disease but will not cure it. Remember to sanitise the pruners before moving on to other plants so that you don't spread the disease.\nFungicides can be used to control leaf spot diseases, but not always needed. There are numerous types of fungicides, including several organic, but the right type to use will depend on the disease you are trying to manage. For instance, applying copper based fungicides weekly at first sign of disease will prevent its spread. This organic fungicide will not kill leaf spot, but prevent fungus from germinating.\nIf a plant in your yard develops leaf spot, send a sample to your local extension officer for recommendations on how to control it. Some farmers will experience symptoms such as yellowing of leaves at the bottom of the plants that eventually fall off. This brings me to the second problem in the garden: nitrogen deficiency.\nYELLOWING LEAVES\nIf the older leaves of your plants are simply turning yellow without spots, they are most likely showing symptoms of nitrogen deficiency. Nitrogen leaches out of the soil rapidly with heavy rainfall, leaving fast growing plants like flowers and vegetables hungry. If the plants in your garden are losing lots of yellow leaves, you should fertilise with slow release or organic fertiliser to replace the nitrogen lost through the rains.\nIn the long term, mulching with organic matter (such as well rotted garden compost or manure) provides a steady trickle of nitrogen to stabilise levels. In the short term, applying high nitrogen fertilisers such as Sulphate of ammonia or poultry manure pellets will remedy the problem. In addition, spraying plants with liquid fertilizer will help plants recover quickly.\nExcessively wet conditions will negatively affect crop production in many ways. Abnormally high amounts of rain will leach nutrients, especially nitrogen, from the soil. Nitrogen added to the soil in the form of granular fertiliser is especially vulnerable to leaching.\nROOT PROBLEMS\nPlant roots need oxygen to survive, especially the tender root hairs that are responsible for absorbing water and nutrients from the soil. Oxygen exists in the small air spaces between soil particles. When these spaces fill up with water, delicate root hairs drown. As a result, plants will wilt, particularly during the heat of the day. This is often a temporary problem, and plant roots are able to recover as long as the soil dries out within a day or two.\nWhen the soil stays wet for an extended time, root rot disease is likely to set in. With these diseases, once a plant wilts it does not recover but gets progressively worse.",

Researchers say that El Nino, which essentially translates to heavy rains, is caused by changes in ocean temperatures that affect weather patterns around the globe.\nThere is approximately a 95 per cent chance that El Nino will continue through the Northern Hemisphere winter 2015/16, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Kenya lies on the Equator. Part of it is in the Northern hemisphere, while the other part is on the Southern Hemisphere, although it is largely on the Eastern Hemisphere.\nThis means, if not all parts of the country will experience El Nino, most parts that lie on the Northern Hemisphere will.\nWith barely a few days into October, when the onset of El Nino is expected, thorough disaster response preparedness among the public should be taking place.\nThe Sh5 billion set aside by the Government and thousands of National Youth Service personnel put on standby in readiness to respond to the occurrence is commendable. It is good to prepare for the worst.\nThe response would however be more effective and swift if the public is involved.\nSensitisation 'barazas' should already be taking place. Energetic, active and courageous persons from every ward need to be identified and taken through the disaster management process. The public needs to know what to do when they experience floods in the night or when their houses are covered in water. There are places like Nyando and Budalang'i that flood even during short rains.\nIn such places, rescue centres should have been identified and the residents notified so that in case of any emergency occurrence their safety is guaranteed. Twenty-four-hour, seven-days-a-week toll-free emergency line should be set up already.\nThe public should be in a position to report any urgent development resulting from the rains to enable fast response from the rescue team.\nThe national Youth Service members require communication gadgets so that their coordination with the Government, humanitarian organisations and other agencies is easy and prompt.\nAmbulances and rescue helicopters need to be considered. For the ambulances, strong, four-wheel-drive vehicles are needed, which can maneuver through muddy areas. Anything can happen to El Nino victims. Setting aside emergency units within county and sub-county hospitals is necessary. To avoid inconveniences by striking doctors and nurses, a special group of medical practitioners should be identified. Floodwaters provide good breeding places for mosquitoes that cause malaria and Rift Valley Fever in human beings and animals.\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) says heavy rains in 1997/98 led to an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever that took several lives.\nThe Centres for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) also indicated that in late 1997, there was outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in East Africa. And in just three months, 90,000 people were reported sick with approximately 500 people dying.",

        "text": "Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that \"The price of greatness is responsibility\" Now I understand why there is no shortcut to maturity.\nHonestly, I have a lot of respect for leaders who respect other leaders. Nevertheless, whoever is under the illusion that there is any quality of leadership exuding from President Uhuru Kenyatta must reexamine his illusion.\nAs a matter of fact, I determinedly profess here that President Kenyatta is not only the weakest, but also one of the wicked Presidents in the world since the departure of Adolf Hitler. The tear-gassing of CORD principals yesterday at the Anniversary Towers signposts how Uhuru's integrity is shockingly unmet. Peradventure, there is no change without a conflict but elders must be respected.\nBy incautiously incapacitating Raila Odinga using teargas, the President confirmed that he lacks respect for his elders cum freedom fighters. Is this not the same president who tear-gassed primary school munchkins when they constitutionally remonstrated over their grabbed playground?\nConstitutionally, PM Raila has an untenably inalienable right to his political future. Thus, he has a right to demand for a change of referee, if he has the best reasons, coupled by unassailable evidence that the referee is working for his opponent.\nIn Premier League, when Manchester United is about to take on the MIGHTIEST team in world ARSENAL FC, they usually question the integrity and fairness of officiators. But because it is their right to do so, the referee is always changed to their convenience to avoid pesky post match complaints and appeals.\nThe incomprehensible abomination done against the Rt. Hon Raila Odinga is not only inconsolable, but also condemnable by all means. In fact, the incongruity encompassed in the process of tear-gassing the leaders will forever remain indelible in the people's minds.\nSincerely, even if Uhuru wanted to run counter to CORD's approach towards disbanding IEBC, were there no other channels rather than that of unleashing the entire military higgledy-piggledy all over the city? I am edified that the Bill Of Rights as envisaged, is the backbone of our constitution. Where is that freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and that of peaceful demonstration?\nI expected Uhuru to gallantly hold back his wrath no matter how deep he is in love with the controversial IEBC. Instead, he naively unleashed a contingent of crackpots on his senior - Yes, senior because some of the fruits President Kenyatta is enjoying, including the multi-party democracy, were paid for by Raila.\nI expected this President to versatilely confab with CORD Principals and comradely demystify the IEBC debacle, only to realize we are living in a country where the rule of the jungle prevails, only the strong survives.\nAs far as integrity and leadership are concerned, I thought my President is an astutely versed egghead, only to realize that he is surrounded by likeminded Team-Mafisi, only thinking on how to develop their stomach infrastructures.\nA Good Samaritan must tell the President that the atrocities he committed against Raila yesterday, one day he will deservedly get his comeuppance. Just like any doomsayer out there, I have an impregnable premonition that Uhuru's imprudent acts will haunt him forever.\nJust like Albert Einstein, I belong to Res ipsa loquitur school of thought. It is an open secret that President Kenyatta begrudges Raila's rich history. Nonetheless, the fact remains that he owes the Prime Minister a huge debt of gratitude and apology.\nThis administration continually gives us the ugly side of leadership. From head to toe, nonchalance, bribery, nepotism and ethnicity clouds public activities.\nJust name them: From the computer typing error, to the NYS scandal where Ksh2billion grew wings and flew with the help of former Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru. From the Ksh20billion El Nino funds, to the $1.4billion Eurobond proceeds where the partners in crime shared the loot and swept the crime under the carpet. Uhuru Kenyatta runs a deliberate porous system where his friends - those that helped him ascend to power - are on a looting competition, if not a looting spree.\nThis president does not care about the well-being of his people. All he cares about is his 2017reelection, the more reason why he jealously guards the treacherous IEBC. To him, it takes rocket science to fix quandaries like these.\nAs a leader of the nation, President Kenyatta has failed to convince Kenyans that he is serious with the fight against graft. Kenyatta's body language neither radiates nor manifests this. To him, the phrase \"leading by example\" is a foreign language.\nWhat sense does it make for the President to 'reportedly' get Ksh2.5m monthly salary while Statehouse spends Ksh8million a day, Ksh56million a week, Ksh224million a month and Ksh2688,000000billion a year on expenses? Isn't this one of the primary reasons why he is fighting hard to retain IEBC?\nRather than tear-gassing school children, fellow leaders and other peaceful demonstrators, what has this President achieved so far to justify his being re-elected?",

        "text": "There is this band of rusty wagons dancing all over about the need to have a third political 'force' in this country.\nThey say the government is dead, and the opposition is also digging their graves.\nThe only option, they say, is for all Kenyans to come together and form an alternative political outfit outside jubilee and cord.\nLet me tell them something.\nI voted for Peter Kenneth in 2013. He packaged himself as the localised Barack Obama, the deliverer of the Kenyan dream. Ladies say he was handsome and gentle, some men say they wanted to be as charismatic as his son, Andrew. Prior to 2013, Peter Kenneth had been hailed as the best manager of CDF funds, in his home constituency of Gatanga.\nFor a group whose greed for (dirty) money has been equated with that of wild swines, Peter Kenneth represented a new breed of MPs with clean hands, and big hearts. He was not entangled into the convoluted tribal mess that Jomo, Toroitich, and Mwai had used to whip those from the wrong tribe back into line. For a man younger than the Nairobi City Council's fire trucks I saw yesterday coughing mud instead of water, Peter Kenneth was to be the alternative for the Kenyatta-Odinga-Moi octogenarian politics that, critics say, has been the reason Kenya cannot move in one piece.\nTurns out he was an Obama counterfeit, and voting him was the worst political decision I have ever made. With the benefit of hindsight, Kenyans should never have even entertained the thought of having Third Forces, or Horses, in the general elections. There is a reason Americans split hairs between Republicans and Democrats, even if you are faced with the choice of an arrogant hairless buffoon on one hand, and an incoherent boring matriarch on the other. Kenya needs only two political parties, whether the Jubilee group of looters is led by an intoxicated mafia don or the Cord infantry division has an ugly voodoo doll as it's figure head.\nAs I go back to the pruned list of serious presidential aspirants in 2013, I am realising that those who came forth as technocratic firm hands neither got the technical leadership credentials to sustain an ideology nor had hands to raise against the incumbency excesses.\nThe price of democracy is eternal vigilance. Kenneth, Kiyiapi, Dida, and Mudavadi want their names chiseled on the same marble slab as Dedan Kimathi, or Tom Mboya, or Wangari Maathai, but have no balls to join Kenyans in putting this recklessly arrogant government in check. In the village, during the long rains, we knew things were bad when our parents told us to take the cardboard out of the glassless windows and use it for our inner soles.\nPeter Kenneth has refused to let us hear his opinion on whether we should let this El Nino government destroy the cardboards on the open windows or let the water sink the mud-house but use the cardboards to help hungry Kenyans swim to school.\nOf the 2013 presidential aspirants, only Raila Odinga has remained standing as he struggles to make himself heard above the noise of organised heckling by those 36 air headed bloggers deriving pay from the people who are looting our economy dry. You ask where the Third Force of Peter Kenneth is to lend his voice to this struggle. Prof. James Kiyiapi has not even sent a thank you sms to his 10 voters since 2013.\nThe last time we heard of Dida, he was appointed to a State Corporation and was still consulting his conscience on whether to take up the job or continue with his comical lecturers. Many cannot even remember who Musalia Mudavadi's running mate was - an excuse of a man who, to describe him as a political infidel, would be modest.\nI have always been told that I have no talent for disguising my feelings. The problem I have with those who claim to be politically objective is that they are too preoccupied defending their objectivity that they cant notice their tribal bigotry showing.\nShow Peter Kenneth a sparrow and he will describe it as either an eagle or a vulture, if at all he gets to open his mouth. Yet these are the Third Forces were are being told to begin considering.\nThe office of the opposition, if ever there was one, is a bed of nails. Peter Kenneth and his gang of 'too cool to fight in the political trenches' Third Force wannabes must be reminded that the wages of political sin is death, not promotion.\nKenya is not a Facebook Album to wow us with your pancake makeup and bleached eyes. And this message also goes to all those we entrusted with leadership in this country - whether you are that Miwani Ward MCA who cant construct a sentence in English or the President of this country hoping from one Formula One race to the next as Kenyans sink deeper into poverty.\nNever Again!.",

        "text": "It's Time for Honesty.\nSTATEMENT BY RT. HON RAILA ODINGA;\nLadies and gentlemen;\nI am happy to be back home ahead of the El Nino.\nI called to speak to you on the sorry state of affairs in our country, particularly our economy.\nSince Jubilee came to power, it has insisted that the economy is growing and Kenyans can sit back and relax. We in Opposition have warned that we are on the road to nowhere.We warned that jubilee is over borrowing, over spending and over stealing.\nWe have warned that the cost of living is rising and Jubilee economics is testing our patience.\nWe raised alarm that the Jubilee Government had increased our public debt by Ksh.860 billion in one year, from Ksh.1.8 trillion to Ksh.2.6 trillion. This was an increase of 50 percent, the largest annual increase in our history. The Grand Coalition government increased the debt by Ksh.900 billion in the five years it was in office, an average of Ksh.190 billion. We warned that Jubilee was borrowing at almost five times the rate at which the Grand Coalition government borrowed.\nWhen we raised questions, we were called names and told off in words that cannot be taken back. Political posturing, bickering and insults replaced honest debate. A lot of time and a lot of trust were lost.An ugly reality now mocks us.\nThe National Treasury has acknowledged that it is facing a cash crunch due to a combination of domestic and international loan repayments falling due, slow collection of government revenue and demands for disbursements. But the wastage and inefficiency persists in government.\nThe recovery and the job creation witnessed between 2003 and 2012 are disappearing.\nI have always believed that people are ready to handle the truth. So I wish to be honest with Kenyans, if the government won't be.\nThe truth is that our economy is underperforming. All of the 10 African countries whose economies are among the 20 fastest in the world are growing at 7 per cent plus. They include:Liberiaa..10.4 per centNiger..........8.0 per centCote D'Ivoirea..7.9 per centEthiopiaa...7.5 per centGhana........7.3 per centMozambique...7.2 per centTanzaniaa..7.2 per centRwanda.......7.1 per centDRC..........7.1 per centZambiaa......7.1 per centUganda......6.2 per centKenya........5.2 per cent.At 5.2 per cent, Kenya's economy is number four within the East Africa Community. We are only better than Burundi. The idea that Kenya is the regiona's biggest economy may soon be a myth. Tanzania will catch up with us in four years and become 20 per cent bigger economy by 2030.\nLast week, Imperial Bank was put under receivership. We last had collapsing banks in the 1990s when YK92 wreaked havoc on our nation.Things are bad at the Nairobi Securities Exchange. The media reported last week that investors at the NSE have lost another Sh60 billion in the last one month. This extended the losses to Sh530 billion since prices of shares started falling seven months ago.The market value of all outstanding shares at the NSE has shrunk by 20 per cent from Sh2.43 trillion in March to Sh1.90 trillion by the end of last week.\nThe collapse of Imperial Bank and the losses at NSE indicate a possibility of capital flight.Our budget deficit stands at 10 per cent of the GDP and 18 per cent of revenue. Our public debt has doubled. Foreign debt has overtaken domestic debt.\nThe external debts are mostly commercial and non-concessional. The cost of servicing our foreign debt is rising faster than domestic one largely as a result of huge commercial loans especially the Eurobond. But there is nothing to show for the big loans. We used to spend 4 per cent of our export revenue on servicing foreign debts. Now we spend 10 per cent.\nLast year, we were told that the Sh289 billion ($2.75 billion) Eurobond loan would stop government borrowing from domestic markets, thereby helping drive down interest rates.\nToday, interest rates are at their highest in more than a decade, inflation has gone haywire, the government is broke and nobody is talking about Eurobond.\nDebt servicing is taking one third of our revenue and it is rising. Our exports have stagnated. But imports are growing. The government is living beyond its means.\nOne would have thought that when we are at the brink, we would see the bigger picture, be humbled by the reality and live up to our responsibilities.One would have thought that this reality would be reason to bridge the gap between far-flung positions and to bring about solutions in the interest of Kenya. Jubilee however sees this as just another moment for hubris, grandstanding, back passing and big talk.Jubilee refuses to agree that mega corruption in the end leaves even the big thieves with nothing to steal and nothing to pay workers like teachers.Sooner rather than later, the figures were going to refuse to add up. Let us be honest, teachers have not been paid, not because they went on strike but because the government is broke. The strike is the excuse. Counties are getting their money too late, if at all.We are only at the beginning of a long, bruising and miserable journey.\nIt is upon the president to ensure that confidence returns both among the Kenyan people and to the Kenyan economy. Yet the President glossed over these issues yesterday.Mr President, we need a clear road map to put Kenya on the path to sustainable and equitable growth. As Opposition, we stand ready to support measures that will steady the economy and ensure respect for our nation. We are ready to support a growth strategy that takes Kenya where it belongs. We know the league this nation should be playing in.\nWe demand a plan that creates a convergence; with productivity, job creation, fairness and inclusivity at the centre of our growth agenda.Mr President, provide Kenyans with a credible course for a stronger and better future.\nPresent to Kenyans a credible system to ensure their bank savings remain safe.\nMr President, multiplication of institutions and putting the country on auto pilot will not deliver more or better results. The tribalism consuming our nation is sanctioned by your government through skewed public service appointments. We long pointed it out. You do not need a national values audit and a council of elders to end it as you said yesterday.Mr President, show Kenyans that you care. Think of the families thrown into uncertainty because their bread winners, serving our country as teachers, cannot be paid. Think of the thousands of suppliers of goods and services to your government whose businesses are collapsing because they have not been paid.\nMr President, we demand stability for the Kenya shilling.\nMr President, no wind will guide a sailor that has no destined port.\nTell Kenyans where you are taking them, how you intend to get there and by when.You asked for, and acquired the mandate to steady, not to wreck the nation.\nDo not underestimate the urgency of the situation Kenya faces.Do not underestimate your imperative to act.Please get up and report on duty.\nHON RAILA ODINGA; EGH\nOCTOBER 21, 2015.",

When a management of a university is so money minded and only concerned about establishing new satellite campuses and partnering with 3rd floor colleges to offer courses at the expense of improving the existing campuses, then you know something is definitely wrong.\nI remember sometimes last year when I served in the Student leadership together with the likes of Economist Bush, Kipsaro Arap Boit, Eric Kinaga, Bonny W Munga Nathaniel Akadima we attended a senate meeting and told it to the face of the vice chancellor Prof Mibei that the management had long forgotten that campuses which register Government sponsored students are part of the university too.\nEvery major development or innovation initiated by the institution was happening at a campus where majority of the students are Private sponsored. Of course the reason is obvious. MONEY. While government sponsored student pay a paltry Ksh 20,000 or less per semester, a private sponsored student pays no less than 70, 000 for the same period and the same course.\nWhile the university was heavily investing in establishing new campuses, back at Main Campus (MC mainly admits Govt sponsored students) the education environment deteriorated each day. The lecture halls remained dilapidated, a common class in the school of Education can carry as much as 1000 students listening to a lecturer teaching without any sound aid. No microphone, no nothing.\nLecturers are very few compared to the population. The library is yet to be updated with new books. The only books available are those authored when Cold war existed. Some still talk of a telegram as among the fastest means of communication.\nThe computers at the library are so few that you might queue the whole day just to browse for 5 minutes before the next person in line reminds you of his right to use the device. The accommodation crisis is another whole problem in itself that if we start talking about it, the Elnino might find us here.\nAs we talk of the above conditions, the institution still makes Millions in profits and continues to invest in introducing new campuses. Mind you, some of these campuses, despite years of investment end up independent and full fledged yet resources meant for Campuses such as Main, Annex School of Law, Medicine School were heavily used to establish them.\nThey include Moi Narok Campus which is now Masai Mara University, Chepkoilel Campus which is now University of Eldoret, Karatina Campus which is now Karatina University among many others.\nBig universities such as Maseno and Masinde Muliro also started as Moi University Campuses but are now better off facility wise compared to Moi Main Campus!\nThe order to close Annex school of Law should wake Mibei and his team from slumber. If nothing is done, Main Campus too will soon enough be dimmed unfit to offer lecture classes.\nPS.\nThe management incompetencies does not mean Moi graduates are half baked as some social media noisemakers and commentators would want to imagine. Without doubt, Moi University students are among the best. Take that to Safaricom headquarters and ask for Mshwari Loan. The challenges have taught them to be go-getters. Most of them go out of their way to research and increase knowledge in their career fields. And again, However few they are, the lecturers are competent and offer the best they can.",

Children's survival is dependent on action taken today,\" she added in a statement.\nIn a late January update, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said El Nino would affect more than 60 million people across parts of Africa, the Pacific, Asia and Latin America.\nThe current impacts of El Nino - a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific - include drought in Central America, southern Africa, Indonesia and the Philippines, and wetter conditions in the southern Horn of Africa, south Brazil, Peru and Ecuador.\nThe extreme weather is hitting production of staple foods in those regions, including maize, rice and wheat.\nIn Africa, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and most provinces in South Africa have declared a disaster, while in Ethiopia, the number of people in need of food aid is expected to rise to 18 million by the end of 2016 from just over 10 million now, Unicef said.\nEthiopian children are increasingly missing school as they have to walk further in search of water after two seasons of failed rains, it added.\nIn Malawi, facing its worst food crisis in nine years, some 2.8 million people are at risk of hunger, and cases of severe acute malnutrition jumped by 100 per cent from December to January, Unicef said.\nMeanwhile, Kenya is experiencing cholera outbreaks aggravated by floods, while in Zimbabwe, a drop in water supplies from the few functioning boreholes is putting people at greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea.\nOCHA has estimated it will take affected communities around two years to recover from El Nino-exacerbated drought - if agricultural conditions improve in the second half of this year, the UN statement said.\nUnicef has appealed for $155 million (Sh15.8 billion) for its work in El Nino-hit African countries this year. So far it has received only 15 per cent of what it needs in southern Africa.\nLast week charity Save the Children said food aid for Ethiopians would",

The study findings imply counties should now consider stocking those drugs as part of the El Nino preparedness strategy.\n\"Snakebites,\" says the study lead author Luis Fernando Chaves, an ecologist at the Nagasaki University Institute of Tropical Medicine in Japan, \"don't get the attention they deserve, even though they are a major problem.\"\nThe World Health Organisation says snakebites are neglected in Africa, where about one million cases are reported annually, mostly among women and children in poor villages.\nIf untreated, bites by venomous snakes can cause death or permanent disability and may result in limb amputation.",

        "text": "A meeting between El Nino and political cynics is expected across the 47 counties this last quarter of the year. The deluge was expected at the end of the first week of this month. Then meteorologists deferred the arrival of the wrath of nature to the end of the second week. Now they expect it any time - even now.\nOn Wednesday, last week, at 4pm, a news weather van furnished with chairs and probably loaded with rain gauges was strategically parked in an unusual location. The van, bearing a GK number plate, was stationed outside the Meteorological Department, along Ngong Road.\nThe weather had changed abruptly that morning. In the afternoon, motorists were running out of town to escape the expected El Nino-induced traffic jam. The sky above Nairobi, the city of impenetrable vehicular jams, where power outages welcome light showers, was overcast. The sky was pregnant with rain, even a trainee met could tell the El Nino was coming.\nThere were also claims the rains had started in the Thika-Juja-Kasarani areas of Nairobi. The ceremonial weather van was probably waiting for the rain outside the perimeter fence of the refurbished Met offices.\nA few minutes later, on arrival at the Karen shopping centre, the clouds were clearing in a hazy smoke-like motion. The clouds were relocating to the areas above the Ngong Hills. The rainbow had formed a circle above the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.\nThe rain did not come on Wednesday in Nairobi. The city would have to wait more days before the apocalyptic deluge. Probably a punishment for defiling the natural environment. Humanity has plundered forests and scavenged the atmosphere with unrelenting fumes and foam.\nWhen the rain comes, it will probably be a blessing to a water-scarce and thirsty city of five million people. Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company last week announced the price of water - Our Water Our Life - would double.\nToday Wednesday, about two weeks after the due date, the much awaited apocalyptic rains are yet to show up as the shortest and heaviest fall during this short rainy season of the year 2015. The weather van is longer parked on Ngong Road. But the vulnerable City of Nairobi is still expecting the \"worst\" El Nino rains since 1965. The 1991 rains and the 1997 El Nino, rain tellers claim, will be child-shower.\nMeteorology may not be a precise science in Kenya, but the cynicism has a context in the previous predictions of the Meteorological Development. Most of the time the mets get it wrong. Sometimes coincidence aides their forecasts.\nThere was a time when, cynics held, mets would fold the blinders, look out of the windows of their offices, before announcing: \"There will be light showers and thunderstorms west of the Rift Valley.\"\nBolder mets would saunter out of the 'situation' room, a cup of tea in hand, with eyes cast beyond the horizon. They would then declare, with finality, ''Tuta kwa na manyunyu hapa na pale\" around Lake Victoria. Sometimes they would declare afternoon lightning and thunderstorms south of the Rift Valley.\nAnd the mets would be deemed to have worked for their pay. The mets have been singularly unconvincing. Their credibility has always been rockbottom. Perhaps it is poor equipment. Perhaps they are analogue. Perhaps a bad worker blames the tools. Sometimes farmers have been misled, with wasted time and seeds.\nWhen mets lie, cynics would have hoped the department would be scrapped, for the time being, to help bring down the public sector wage bill. But, maybe there is something else meteorologists do apart from misleading farmers.\nMets are probably the reason there is cynicism about El Nino. Governments are reporting varied states of preparedness. The county reports show huge budgets for the expected and unexpected outcome of the El Nino season. The counties and the country will be running parallel budgets.\n\"It is upsetting that the national and county governments have parallel budgets for disaster preparedness. This is just stealing from the taxpayer,\" James Some, an Eldoret businessman, expressed the growing cynicism. Politicians want to exploit the expected and the unexpected to make hay.\nThe national government has allocated Sh8 billion for disaster preparedness. Uasin Gishu county government has allocated about Sh50 million \"for something that is only expected\". North Rift cynics say this is extravagant. Nandi county has located Sh500 million for El Nino preparedness. This is a huge allocation in a county of escarpments and hills, without a history of flooding and landslides.\nThe El Nino phenomenon comes with unusually heavy rains and floods. These are attributed to drastic climate changes, which result in periodic severe droughts and flooding, extreme heat and cold.\nMachakos county government started the preparation much earlier. Governor Alfred Mutua reported the county government would de-silt dams and construct new ones for harvesting and storing rain water.\nNo such plans have been reported from drought- and flood-prone parts of Nyanza region. Around the world's second largest fresh water mass, Lake Victoria, droughts and floods devastate with equal severity.\nConsider this: Perennial drought in West Karachuonyo, Homa Bay county, came into national focus in March, last year, during a media campaign to call attention to the plight of this impoverished and thirsty community. The only source of water at the time was, and now is, the half-done Kobondo Dam. The dam is the initiative of the community and retired Anglican Church of Kenya Bishop Haggai Nyang.\nKobondo Dam, the oasis of hope in this drought-prone area, serves a population of 18,000 during drought, which is six months a year, peaking into desperation between January to March. This number sometimes swells to 25,000 people spread across three electoral wards of West Karachuonyo, Kibiri and Northwards of Karachuonyo constituency.\nWomen, children, and herders travel about 12km, or 15km at peak, both ways, in all directions for water. Women wake up as early as 4am, with children trekking along to fetch water. They travel the rough and dusty terrain, carrying water in pots, pails and jerrycans that make their effort exhausting. The first trip to fetch water ends at 7.45am, when tired and hungry children prepare for school, sleepy and exhausted. The women then travel back for water to collect the brown and greenish dirt-filled liquid at 10am before livestock move in to complicate their struggle. Fetching water takes most of the day for the poor women. School dropouts are peaking and truancy is routine.\nMost water pans have died up - months after April - June rains, due to heavy siltation.\nHere, like elsewhere across the country, El Nino rains will cause havoc just like drought. There is no political will to break the jinx of the alternating devastation from droughts and floods.",

        "text": "This might be the time to do away with water bills.\nFor the next four months, Kenyans will be inundated with torrents of the most natural form of water available - the El nino rainwater.\nWill it all go to waste? This is one of the biggest tests facing Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa.\nThe El Nino is usually followed by long periods of dry weather, meaning Kenya could be staring at an unconfirmed drought next year.\nExperts are now advising Kenyans, and the government, to save the El nino waters for the sunny days ahead.\nWamalwa says they are indeed planning on harvesting the rain water and use it for food production.\n\"It is unfortunate that water has been source of risk instead of being used in food production,\" he says.\nWamalwa rests his hopes on the Water Bill, which is currently in the Senate. He says the Bill should be fast-tracked.\nSenate resumes sittings next week and players in the water sector hope the House business committee will prioritise the Bill and pass it before the skies open.\nIt provides for the regulation, management and development of water resources, water and sewerage services.\nWamalwa says it is possible to harness rainwater for household use, agriculture, industrial as well as for livestock and environmental improvement.\nDeputy director of meteorological department Peter Ambenje says the El Nino rains will start early next month.\nHe says the entire country - with the exception of Turkana and northern Pokot - will receive at least 125 per cent of the average October-December rains, until January next year.\n\"Signs have indicated this is a strong El Nino event, but we have to wait and see,\" Ambenje adds.\nAlthough the rains are unlikely to unleash the destruction witnessed in the 1997 El Nino, the government has set aside Sh5 billion emergency fund and put on standby 70,000 National Youth Service volunteers.\nThe money is from the Contingency Fund under the National Treasury.\nWamalwa could not confirm if part of this money will help in water harvesting.\nKenya is among the water scarce countries whose water storage per capita deteriorates with time to critical levels.\nWhile 85 per cent of people in towns can access clean water, only 49 per cent of those in rural areas do, according to the World Bank.\nThe Water Bill establishes a National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority to develop storage plans and facilities, advise the Cabinet Secretary, develop a water harvesting policy and enforce water harvesting strategies.\nHowever, it is unlikely, even if the Bill is passed immediately, that such an authority would immediately spring to action from scratch and harvest El Nino water.\nPlayers in water sector say Wamalwa's ministry has enough structures to lead water harvesting projects, without the Bill.\nThe CS admits water and irrigation in the country is key in enhancing food security and cutting the importation of foods such as rice and maize.\n\"We have a shortage of 10 million bags of maize that needs to be imported. There has been a serious debate on sugar importation in the country but we produce 500,000 metric tonnes against consumption of 800,000 leaving a deficit of 300,000. We also import 10 million bags of maize,we have to import to gap shortage,\" says Wamalwa.\nThe rains will begin and end at varying times across the country. The Coast, Northeastern, Central and Nairobi, Embu and Meru counties will receive the rains in the second week of October until January. The same applies to the central Rift Valley counties like Nakuru, Narok, Kajiado and Nyahururu.\nSouth Eastern counties, including Voi, Taita Taveta, Makindu and Tana River, will receive the first rains in the second to third week of October.\nThe Kenya Rainwater Association (KRA) says rainwater harvesting is an old established technology in Kenya.\n\"Observations in most of our urban centres show that rainwater-harvesting structures are not integrated into the building but are added as an afterthought. This is due to the existing by-laws and lack of awareness by planners, policy makers, beneficiaries and many engineers,\" says the projects coordinator Dr Stephen Ngigi. The association advises Kenyans to harvest water both for farming and domestic use.\nWhat to do before the rains come\n1. Rainwater harvesting can be as simple as either leaving empty containers under the rain or connecting these to pipes so rainwater can be collected.\n2. Have a proper drainage inspection done on your property.\n3 V-shaped ditches can be installed on slopes to catch and redirect the water so that it does not shear down the slope, taking the soil with it.\n4. In urban areas you can build concrete retaining walls to save your property from sliding into your home, or your neighbor's home.\n5. Mulch for erosion control. Mulch can help keep your soil intact. Chipped and shredded garden waste for shambas while, for parking areas and walkways susceptible to erosion, rocks and gravel are a good mulch that won't wash away.\n6. Divert water. Use concrete edging to redirect water out of vulnerable areas. Flower beds, for instance, can be lined with concrete barriers in strategic locations to keep water away.",

We are spending several productive hours debating whether the rains will come or not.\nWe are spending several hours locked up in boardrooms deciding how much to spend on bar soaps yet we have no plans for a permanent solution towards the recurring flooding.\nWe need to develop ambitious plans to stop flooding that is experienced during every rainy season.\nFlooding has led to losing of lives, property and rendered many homeless. Flood waters provide ample breeding grounds for waterborne diseases.\nClimate change effects are likely to exacerbate flooding. Flood-prone areas will experience worse cases and new areas may record flooding instances as well.\nHarvesting floodwaters would be ideal, especially in the low-lying areas. Water from uplands normally flows down to the lowlands. Because the soil in the plains has poor infiltration; water stagnates, causing floods.\nThe harvested water can be stored and used for irrigation. Most flood-prone areas are hard hit by climate change; they dry up fast.\nThe Kano Plain for instance always flood to an extent the water covers houses. The plain is the major source of rice in Western Kenya. However, rice production is unsustainable because of unreliable water supply.\nInvesting in water reservoirs for irrigation would help increase crop production in flood-prone areas while reducing floods negative effects.\nHarvesting requires the construction of dams and channels that will collect and guide the water to the reservoirs.\nThe harvested water could also be used for domestic purposes and drinking by livestock. People spend a lot of time searching for water during the dry season.\nPiping and distributing the water would save the people a lot of time that can be used on more prolific activities.\nThe harvested water could be used on fish ponds and commercial fish farms. Fish farms have become common among individuals that want to diversify their sources of food and income.\nWhile the idea may seem expensive, it is more beneficial to losing lives, property and animals. It will boost the economic status of the locality and that of the nation.\nThe billions of shillings budgeted for El Nino by the county and national government should be used for this purpose.\nDikes and levees are essential for preventing river and lake floods. Levees were built along the Mississippi River several decades ago.\nLake Baringo has been flooding, causing havoc, but little has been done to arrive at a permanent solution. Knowing that the lake will burst its banks anytime the water level rises, shouldn't we have a long-term solution?\nExpansion of sewer lines to accommodate floodwaters in urban centres is indisputable. Unclogging drainages is not enough. The case of Nairobi a few months ago",

        "text": "There was a time when I became quite fascinated by cosmology which is the science of the origin and development of the universe. Sir Martin Rees has written the most accessible book in this regard and its called Just 6 Numbers. In this book, Martin Rees puts forward six equations which govern our universe, a universe so big that we are like a grain of sand on a beach. The mathematics of these equations is so miraculous that Rees speaks to a \"cosmic tuning\" phenomenon.\nFor example;   0.3: the ratio of the actual density of the universe to the critical (minimum) density required for the universe to eventually collapse under its gravity.  determines the ultimate fate of the universe. If >1, the universe will experience a big crunch. If  < 1, the universe will expand forever;\nAt the macro scale, at the scale of the stars, everything is so finely tuned its breathtaking.\nLets now go the micro scale, the grain of sand that we represent. Last month was the hottest October in 136 years of data and represented the eighth record-breaking month so far in this record-breaking year [Bloomberg]. Last month wasn't just the hottest October on record-it was the biggest departure from normal for any month in the past 136 years, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nI like following prices and charts and what is clear is that we are now in uncharted territory. These new milestones follow the hottest summer on record, the hottest 12 months on record, the hottest calendar year on record (2014), and the hottest decade on record. The El Nino weather pattern disperses heat into the atmosphere which lingers and that means that this heat-wave is certain to spill into 2016. I cannot help feeling we are like frogs in boiling water. We have created massive interference in the ''cosmic tuning'' phenomenon.\nThe question is how does an investor navigate this new ''weather normal''. So far this year, the only commodity that has delivered a double digit percentage increase is Cocoa. Cocoa for delivery in March closed at the highest level since March 2011. The commodity has risen 17 per cent this year, the biggest gain in the S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials. By the way, The Ivory Coast [the main supplier of Cocoa to world markets] is the current SSA darling with the IMF. forecasting an 8.4% GDP Expansion in 2015/2016 more than double the predicted SSA GDP expansion rate for the same period.\nCote D'Ivoire is a signal in the noise for investors. The new temperature normal is surely going to play havoc with food supplies and soft commodity prices.",

        "text": "For a few days, possibly a week, there was a suspicion that certain people in government were taking people for a ride with talk of El-Nino. Perhaps it was just another one of those schemes to fleece. What should have made people realize that El-Nino would come was that the people who do the stealing often need little justification to do their scandalous deeds. And so the rains over the last week plus, have been welcomed with relief by those in official positions even as those who have to commute during rush hour, have occasionally suffered.\nWhile the rains have clearly been heavier than normal in areas such as Nairobi, Thika, Embu and Western Kenya, there are those areas where the rains are yet to turn up like Machakos, Lodwar and Makindu where there has not been a drop of rain in October. So who are the lucky ones? The people for whom the rain is now becoming a daily feature of life or those who continue to experience dry weather?\nThe answer from a public health perspective is neither. Public health problems exist whichever the predominant weather pattern but are made worse by extreme weather change.\nSo people are at greatest risk when the weather is dry then becomes very wet. One of the more common diseases that emerge under such conditions and give a good indication of the quality of health services, apart from frequent strikes, is the incidence of diarrhoea.\nIn one four year study in Ecuador, heavy rainfall that followed periods of dry weather led to more cases of diarrhoea. And this occurred despite availability of sanitation.\nThe cause was attributed to contamination of drinking water, which occurred after heavy rains. The same results were found in Bangladesh, where every increase of 10mm of rain above the normal rainfall average was associated with a four percent rise in the number of cases of diarrhoea. Most affected were the poorer segments of the society together with those with inferior sanitation.\nMany people describe diarrhoea to be any episode of loose stool, but the medical definition is loose, watery stool that occur more frequently than usual.\nThat is the stool has to be both loose and frequent. Often the symptoms and signs of diarrhoea are mild, though discomforting and resolve on their own after a day or two. But if they persist then the horrible non-word \"diarrhoeaing\" emerges. It is one of those words that people say, they are corrected, and refuse to yield, despite the acknowledgement that if they are asked to write it down, they cannot spell it and what; it just looks bad. Perhaps it reflects how they feel. The origin of the word diarrhoea",

The number of those who got displaced and sought refuge at Nyora and Kabuto primary schools is 550.\nAnyanga said: \"The national and Migori governments had agreed to set aside funds for floods in the county, for Nyatike in particular. Only Migori is tackling the plight.\"\n\"We are facing an outbreak of waterborne diseases and losing property even though we had earlier been alerted about the disaster,\" he also told the Star on phone on Sunday.\nThe preparedness committee made up of the national and Migori governments had estimated that Sh485 million would be required. The county had set aside Sh120 million.\nThe number of those affected may rise, Migori deputy speaker and North Kadem MCA Boaz Okoth told the press at Kabuto primary school last Saturday.\n\"Governor Okoth Obado told me the national government is yet to release funds to Migori though many families have been affected,\" he said.\nThe politicians asked the government to build dikes along rivers Migori and Kuja, which often break their banks, to end the perennial flooding problem.\nCounty disaster management director John Mwita said a local funds initiative is being used in the absence of government funding.\n\"We plan to give tents, mosquito nets, medicine and other non-food items to all those affected,\" Mwita said.\nHe said the committee has set up a rescue centre at Nyora primary school and that the roads department was asked o build trenches.",

        "text": "Recent data collected by climate scientists shows that conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean at the beginning of May 2014 were similar to those observed in May 1997, which was the last time the world witnessed one of the strongest El Nino episodes.\nEl Nino events occur every two to seven years and usually last for 12 to 18 months. Since 1997, the climate science community has improved their understanding of the nature, impact and predictability of the El Nino phenomenon. The socio-economic and even ecological impacts on of El Nino induced climate anomalies, such as droughts, floods and infectious disease outbreaks, often linger for a long time.\nA paper published in Nature Climate Change by Wenju Cai of Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization show that the number of El Nino events will stay pretty much the same but will be more intense and become more extreme or \"super\" El Ninos. The scientists warn that we should expect a higher frequency of devastating weather events, with severe implications for 21st century climate. The fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has shown that warming of the climate system is unequivocal with many of the observed changes unprecedented over decades to millennia.\nObserved warming conditions have persuaded scientists to project almost a 70 per cent chance that an El Nino will form in the next three months. Since the planet has warmed considerably since the last strong El Nino 17 years ago, it is highly likely that the 2014-15 El Nino could be of the monster variety, with record shattering extreme rainfall in our part of the world.\nTo get a sense of the potential impact of the imminent 2014-15 El Nino, it might help to remind us of the impacts of the 1997-98 El Nino. Globally, the 1997-98 El Nino claimed more than 20,000 lives and caused damage to property and infrastructure estimated at $100 billion.\nIn Kenya, rainfall was 60 to 100 times heavier than normal. There was a large outbreak of the Rift Valley Fever in North Eastern. RVF is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, which affects humans and livestock. Pastoralists reported losing up to 70 per cent of their livestock. Moreover, about 89,000 people were infected and 500 deaths were caused by hemorrhagic fever. The 1997-98 El Nino also triggered an outbreak of malaria. Highland malaria was reported in West Pokot, Uasin Gishu, Kericho, Kisii, Nandi, Nyamira and Bomet. Unlike the coastal counties and the Lake Victoria basin, the populations who live in highlands generally lack immunity.\nAccording newspaper reports, two million Kenyans were in need of emergency food aid by December 1997. Across the country, 300,000 households were displaced due to flooding. Most of the victims were in Tana River, Nyakach, Nyando, Budalangi, Garissa and Mandera. Cholera outbreaks were reported in the Lake Victoria region, Mombasa and Nairobi. Prof Shem Wandiga of the University of Nairobi and his colleagues have shown that El Nino events tiger aquatic conditions, which allow proliferation of Vibrio cholera, the bacterium that causes cholera.\nEl Nino rains of 1997-98 gutted Kenya's transport sector. It estimated that about 100,000km of rural and urban roads were destroyed, paralysing transport and communication in many parts. In January 1998, the Nairobi-Mombasa highway was closed indefinitely after a 30km stretch was damaged by flash floods. The cost of infrastructure damage was estimated at about $670 million (96.8 billion).\nKenya's maize production dropped from average of 2.2 million metric tonnes to 1.83 million, a 20 per cent reduction. Researchers have shown that the El Nino events can reduce maize yields by more than four per cent. However, the worst effect of the El Nino was on the second season crops, grown in the bi-modal rainfall areas of western, central and eastern parts of Kenya.\nThe forecast for the 1997-98 El Nino was received by June 1997 but the government, civil society and local communities failed to act. We can find perfectly legitimate reasons for failure. But we cannot afford to bungle the 2014-15 El Nino, especially when we know that its impacts will make the last El Nino look like a cakewalk. We must take immediate measures to manage its potential direct and indirect impacts.\nOnce bitten, twice shy. El Nino is a predictable natural disaster. It must not become a humanitarian disaster.\nDr Awiti is the director of the East African Institute and assistant professor at Aga Khan University",

A three-month forecast released last week shows most of the country will be dry and cool in the next three months.\nThe report is in line with latest global forecasts that predict a weak El Nino will start late July or August. Head of Kenya Meteorological Services James Kongoti said Kenyans should expect dry and cool weather up to August.\nHowever, the western highlands, the Lake Victoria basin, parts of central Rift Valley like Nakuru and Nyahururu, and the Coastal strip will continue to receive near-normal rainfall. Nairobi, Embu, Meru and Nyeri will have occasional light rains.\n\"The generally dry weather condition expected elsewhere in the country implies that the crops in these areas will be adversely affected leading to poor harvest,\" Kongoti said in a statement.\nSome crops might be salvaged because the cloudy conditions and light rains may reduce evaporation rates and increase soil moisture.\nThe expected El Nino might be a blessing for Kenya because it will be weak and probably come during the short rains season late this year.\nGlobal models show 85 per cent probability El Nino will happen, bringing moderate rains in East Africa and dry weather in South Africa.",

        "text": "While the Kenya Meteorological department has confirmed no El Nino storm is coming before August, the organisers of the World Cup in Brazil are not taking any chances.\nThe El Nino brings rains in East Africa but in Brazil, it is responsible for scorching temperatures and teams have already prepared for that.\nThus the ongoing World Cup will go down to history as the most scientific and technologically advanced football tournament ever seen.\nFrom players donning smart jerseys and looking all cool, the advanced boots that the players are wearing in the matches which enhance their speed and skill, no stone has been left unturned in providing the best experience for audiences and players alike. Already, temmperatures in Brazil are beginning to soar as the El Nino slowly brews.\nBut kit manufacturers have done their utmost to provide garments that will keep players cool. Nike's mantra for the tournament, for example, is 'Cool under pressure'.\nIn designing their kits, such as that worn by the Brazil national team, they combined technical fabrication with thermo-regulation, says a report by Daily Mail.\nBrazil's 2014 World Cup jersey has 56 per cent more airflow than previous versions.It is also composed of 94 per cent polyester and just 6 per cent cotton - giving it the comfortable feel of cotton, but the heat regulation properties of polyester.\nAdidas, meanwhile, have something even more impressive up their sleeves - literally.Called adiPower, they have designed a series of pre-cooling sleeves and vests that can be worn by players before and after matches, or during training.\nThey are designed to help leading football players prepare for games in warm climates - environmental temperatures of 24C and over - by reducing body temperatures and delaying the onset of heat-induced fatigue.\nThe garments are cooled in a freezer before being worn by a player, bringing their temperature down over 15 to 20 minutes.\nThe high-tech pre-cooling concept includes a number of 'hyper absorbent granule zones' specifically located around the lower arms and upper back, which rigorous testing has revealed to be the body's primary cooling areas.\nThe boots are also designed to suit the weather. They are the most important part of any player's attire.The old clunky footwear seen by players in past competition have been replaced by sleek and stylish boots that come with a full package of technological milestones to aid in their game.\nPortugal and Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the players that are wearing the recently unveiled Mercurial Superfly boot launched by Nike.The boots use a three-knit weave to put less material between the foot and the ball, enhancing the players' touch.\nThe Dynamic Fit Collar around the top of the boot, meanwhile, is designed to create a better fit and make it feel more natural.\nA tendon-like support called a Brio cable also connects the upper section of the boot and the heel that, according to Nike, 'acts like a slingshot that helps propel the player forward.'\nAdded studs at the boot's heel offer stability, and extra traction has been placed at the toe to give players more grip and propulsion during the critical final 10 per cent of their stride.'\nOther players such as Belgium's Marrouane Fellaini and Ivory Coast's Kolo Toure, meanwhile, will be wearing boots designed by Wilmslow-based Warrior Global.\nOne of their boots is known as the Gambler. This has nylon stacks positioned on the front of the boot to absorb the speed of the ball and give additional control.\nA revised, more ergonomic plate on the instep provides more aggressive grip and control, while the intricately designed sole gives better traction and comfort.\nWarrior's other boot is the Skreamer, made of microfibres to give players an incredibly lightweight experience.\n\nIts major innovation, however, is a '4D Arrowbed Insole' that actually stimulates blood circulation in the foot.\n\nAside from frozen vests, Daily Mail says Adidas has another technology to help players during training called the Smart Ball. Built-in sensors monitor how hard it is struck, track flight trajectories and reveal impact points for penalties and corners. It helps players learn and master various kicking and control skills.\nThe technological advancement is however not left to the players only because during the matches, referees will have access to a foam, water-based, vanishing spray that will be carried in special belts.",

        "text": "With the El Nino rains already here, geologists have warned that landslides might occur some parts of the country.\nWhile the rains will revitalise farming, experts also fear the heavy rains will saturate soils with water and trigger landslides.\nThe government has advised villagers in North Rift, who live in the landslides prone areas, to move.\nBut they have remained defiant to calls to vacate. The question they ask is, where do they go to?\nSimeon Marachi, a resident of Kabechei area in Keiyo South Constituency, says they they have nowhere to take their belongings.\n\"People have not moved out in this area because they don't know where to run. The government is warning us to move to safer places but to where now since the whole of this region is a valley?\" Marachi asks.\nMost of their crops are still in the farms and the villagers are not willing to leave them behind. \"Most of them here will not believe anything about El Nino until it occurs. Landslides have been affecting here and despite that most of the people have continued building their destroyed homes on the same place since there is no extra land,\" Marachi says. Another resident, Samuel Chepng'etuny from Chepsio village, who lost his brother to a landslide in 2012, still lives in the same village.\n\"Even if we are told to run to our relatives or friends, we are living in the same area with them and extensive part of the valley is prone to mudslides,\" Chepng'etuny said.\n\"Unless the government thinks of a long-lasting solution, property and lives will still be lost to landslides since moving out is not a solution because landslides can strike any time,\" he says.\n\"There are areas with weak soils despite having trees and are prone to mudslides due to heavy downpour,\" says Uasin Gishu Kenya Forest Service ecosystem conservator Paul Karanja.\nResidents at the border of Nandi and Kakamega Counties at Chepnyogoson and Kuvasali were also hit by a landslide few years ago but they still inhabit the escarpment.\nThe phenomenon is common in most other parts of the country where victims still live despite past disasters.\nKocholwa location chief Joseph Yego said they have sensitised people in the valleys and warned them to move out until the El Nino stops.\nHe said most villagers have nowhere to relocate at the moment, and urged the government to identify land and relocate them there.\n\"Landslides have been occurring here since 1961 and the government should buy them land and make the region a conservancy,\" Yego said.\nNandi county executive in charge of land and environment John Chumo says they have formed a committee that will handle the disaster related to El Nino rains.\nChumo said the County Assembly has approved the Sh15 million in the budget for disaster, although about Sh500m was required.\n\"That is why we are calling out on the national government and development partners to help us with the funds. In areas we have mapped out, damages can cost up to Sh500 million and we are wondering where to get it,\" Chumo explained.\nDr Thomas Munyao, a geologist and lecturer at the University of Eldoret's school of environmental studies explain that landslides are just only one of the disasters that can be associated with El Nino rains.\n\"In Kenya, likely impacts are many and include loss of life, infrastructure, income, land value and other socio-economic impacts,\" Munyao said.\nHe said Kenya is not fully prepared in case of landslides since aspects of preparedness includes early warning systems, land availability in case of relocation, resources for new infrastructure , ready teams to mitigate health related impacts and accurate zoning-off of vulnerable areas.\n\"Both government and non-governmental agencies have been warning inhabitants to relocate to safer areas yet most of them can't afford to do that,\" Munyao said.\nConstitutional provisions, he said, allows the government to identify safer areas to settle those in vulnerable regions and then rehabilitate the vacated fragile zones.\n\"For example by turning them into forests. However, that requires clear policy and subjection to strategic environmental assessment,\" he added.\nIn April 2010, 11 people perished to a landslide at Kittony village in Elgeyo Marakwet County. About 30 other people died in 2012 and December 2013 when landslides occurred at Rokocho, Kocholwo, Molol, Kabechei and Kaptarakwa in Keiyo south.\nThe 1997 El Nino rains saw a larger part of Timboroa and Kipkurere Forests in Uasin Gishu County sink together with trees. In 1997, Murang'a was the most hit by landslides in Kenya.",

Continuation of relatively warmer temperatures is expected especially during nights,\" he said on Tuesday in a seven-day forecast.\nScientists have predicted a high likelihood of Kenya experiencing a la Nina, which brings diminished rainfall and possibly drought.\nDirector of Kenya Meteorological Service James Kongoti had earlier warned farmers to liaise with the Ministry of Agriculture to offset any expected farming challenges the depressed rains may bring.\nHe said the rains would be depressed in most parts of the country but especially the eastern region.\nIn most parts of Western, Nairobi and Rift Valley the rains were predicted to start from the second and third week of March.\nKongoti said large swathes of the Eastern region would remain generally dry in March, with seasonal rainfall likely to be recorded in April.\nSunny and dry weather conditions are expected to be dominant in Northwestern and Northeastern Kenya this month.\nThe latest report says Mandera has recorded the highest daily maximum temperature of 40.6C this month.\n\"In April, near-average rainfall is expected over the Western highlands, Lake Victoria basin, central Rift valley, central highlands, including Nairobi, the Coastal strip and Northern Kenya (Marsabit and Moyale),\" Kongoti said.\nHowever, the Food and Agriculture Organization said it does not foresee biting food shortage in Kenya because the 2015/16 \"short-rains\" harvest was above-average levels.\n\"Here, abundant rainfall, largely attributed to the strong El Nino phenomenon, despite some localized floods, benefited crops through an even temporal and spatial distribution and a timely onset, which induced farmers to significantly increase the area planted,\" FAO says in its latest report on Kenya.",

The heavy El Nino rains that fell in the last quarter of 2015 also dampened agricultural output, further piling pressure on food prices.\nThe differences in inflation outcomes among the population are linked to the different consumption habits. The cost of living is also impacted by the different shopping basket mix used to measure inflation outside Nairobi, which largely comprises basic items like food.\nNairobi with a higher concentration of wealthy Kenyans spends a smaller portion of its income on necessities like food, making it less prone to changes in prices of agricultural commodities.\nWealthy homes are often cushioned against food inflation because food accounts for a negligible portion of their income unlike the poor, who spend nearly half their income on food.\nThe recent decline in petroleum prices has continued to reduce motoring and transport expenses for the urban rich, easing the burden on consumers.\nTransport takes up the largest share (over a quarter) of the wealthy homes' budgets, making them the biggest winners of lower petrol prices that dived 11.6 per cent last year in line with a slump in global crude prices.\nThe low-price party for the rich was further supported by a steady decline in electricity prices, with the drop in tariffs for consumers of more than 50 units monthly. Though life remains expensive in Nairobi, the Economic Survey data shows that the cost of goods is rising faster in the other counties, weakening the purchasing power of workers who on average earn less than their counterparts in the city.\nNairobi's average cost of living measure stood at 6.1 per cent last year, below the 6.9 per cent for the remaining 46 counties, indicating a faster increase in the cost of goods in the countryside.\nFood inflation stood at 11.4 per cent, towering above other goods in the basket that is used to track price changes and to calculate inflation.",

First, its growth improved to 5.6 per cent from 5.2 per cent.\nIn terms of overall importance in the economy, it accounted for 30 per cent of the domestic output or Gross Domestic Product (GDP), up from 27 per cent.\nThere is obviously some cheer in that, as the majority of Kenyans depend on the sector. When there is enough food, most Kenyans are happy and hopefully have money too.\nBut a closer look tells you that most of the expansion was down to rain-fed farming, in this particular case the El Nino-induced rains that started last November.\nThat tells you the country is still too exposed to the basic agrarian economy, which we should be aspiring to change.\nOn one side manufacturing only improved 3.5 per cent which is better than the previous year's 3.2 per cent.\nThe sector was mainly driven by manufacturing of beverages and to some extent textile products. But it remained stuck in the 10 percentile share of GDP after rising a mere 300 basis points last year.\nOur view is that all the sectors are important and should receive a lot of attention. But agriculture needs to improve, not only quantitatively but also qualitatively.\nAnd the best way to do so apart from carrying out irrigation, on small and large scale, is to turn agriculture produce into manufactured products.\nAlready we are seeing a lot of that happening but we need to see this being the end-game as a matter of policy. Githunguri Dairy for years has led the way in improving processing and enriching farmers.\nBut this must happen with all crops and in every village until we satisfy the domestic market and start exporting to the neighbouring countries before they set up their own manufacturing units.\nCountries like New Zealand, Denmark and Netherlands have improved their economies using agriculture. There nothing preventing us from doing so.\nAgro-processing, not primitive agriculture, is the way to industrialise fastest. County and national policies must be oriented towards this comparative advantage.",

We wanted to spare no detail in making the resort appealing not only to the business traveller but also tourists travelling the Samburu circuit looking for a break and the Nairobian looking for a relaxing weekend getaway,\" she said.\nInitially, construction of the hotel was meant to be completed by last December but Ms Ratna said the heavy El Nino rains caused delays.\n\"We did not want to open just half the venue and have visitors while construction was still ongoing. We wanted the guests to have the complete feel of the resort including the spa experience,\" she explained.\nThe firm secured $17.8 million funding from the International Finance Corporation to build the multi-purpose, 11-storey, Panari Centre in Nairobi.\nThe centre, which has a five-star, 137-room airport hotel, a shopping facility, conference centre, an ice-skating rink, two movie theatres and additional facilities opened the Mombasa Road operation in 2005.\nFour years ago the company set up 10 units of furnished three and four-bedroom residences targeting long-stay clients such as diplomats and families visiting Nairobi but looking for alternatives to hotel accommodation.\n\"Diplomats who are either moving in or out of their official residences as well as families attending weddings have been the main source of business though we have had families from as far as Uganda and Tanzania who have relatives seeking treatment within the city,\" she said.",

For few months down the line, the chorus will be familiar as tonnes of food waste away in storage, wilting farmer fortunes and fanning the feast or famine cycle.\nWe have been there before. It is a situation researchers have aptly captured in numerous studies that show that in Kenya despite having made impressive strides in improving farming practices and investing in modern agro inputs, which have boosted yields, post-harvest losses continue to present crises of gargantuan proportions.\nFarmers lose up to 40 per cent of their yields to after harvest losses blamed on simple and avoidable mistakes like poor drying or use of substandard storage pesticides.\nIn African countries up to $4 billion is lost each year in after harvest maize grain losses as a result of poor storage facilities.\nStoring maize without proper drying has not only created massive losses due to the deadly aflatoxin fungus, but has also been responsible for deaths of unsuspecting people after eating highly contaminated maize.\nAgriculture secretary Willy Bett has already sounded the alarm over post-harvest losses especially by smallholder farmers due to the increasing wet conditions and lack of requisite drying facilities which will cost the country a million bags of maize.\nIt is pointless to heavily invest in good agricultural practices, attain high yields, and lose 40 percent of it. Feeding the nation does not only require increased production but also a safeguard of all that is produced.\nIndeed the national government deserves a pat on the back. The decision to waive the cost of drying produce delivered to the National Produce and Cereals Board (NCPB) means that farmers can now realize more profit margins and the process will entice more farmers to deliver to the board promoting safe drying.\nThe onus is now on county governments. The waiver on drying charges needs support where the peril of moisture content and the threat of aflatoxin is real.\nFarmers still trek hours on end to access an NCPB depot to get their maize dried. The county governments should establish model depots where these services are offered free of charge to farmers.\nAs we stare at unprecedented climatic phenomena which is leaving most of our smallholder farmers at the mercy of the heavens, we also need to evaluate what we can do to arrest agriculture's choke points before they spiral out of control.\nAddressing post-harvest losses should be one of our priorities.",

        "text": "Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) governor Patrick Njoroge held his New Year press briefing last Thursday where he made public his outlook for the year and addressed key issues currently outstanding in public finance and the financial services market. The excerpts.\nOpposition leader Raila Odinga has recently named the CBK as one of the institutions that played a negative role in the controversial Eurobond affair and called on authorities to investigate some of the institution's senior staff. What is your position?\nClaims that $999 million (Sh100 billion) is missing from the CBK accounts are far from the truth. There was a balance $999 million in JP Morgan sovereign bond account and the National Treasury instructed the CBK to transfer the balance from the sovereign bond account at CBK and close the JP Morgan account.\nSo the CBK acquired the $999 million and credited the National Treasury account with Sh88 billion. That is the simple transaction and this we do all the time.\nThe account that was credited with the US dollars is a CBK account in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We at CBK have accounts with so many other central banks in the world because we are regularly working with them in our normal course of business.\nThere was another transaction on December 17. The amount in US dollars was $815 million and it was converted to Kenya shillings at the then prevailing rate such that the Treasury account was credited with Sh73.8 billion.\nShareholders of Imperial Bank have accused you of not responding to their proposal to reopen the bank and instead going ahead to pay some of its depositors and hand over details of their clients to other banks. What is the bank's response to these claims?\nWe have been talking with the shareholders from the beginning and we have said we can reopen the bank. What we needed and still do is to have the bank recapitalised.\nWe needed resources to reopen the bank not for a month but to keep it open. We knew the shareholders could do it for they are people of means. We made it clear that the burden is fully on the shareholders but we were willing to pass some of that burden to the depositors.\nIt is a bit ingenious of them if they think all they need to do is give us a little money and we as regulators throw our weight behind a plan we do not believe will keep the bank open.\nYes they say they have a proposal to pump in Sh10 billion; we wanted enough resources to reopen the bank in November, that didn't happen because no resources came. We told them we have an account here, put the money there and we get moving but nothing happened, giving us the impression that they were unwilling to move in that direction.\nWe had no choice but to take the direction we have outlined. I will say it now loud and clear that there is an account here at the CBK and if indeed there is Sh10 billion out there, put it in that account then we talk. Let's be sincere; this is not a game.\nThe December inflation figure crossed the upper limit of 7.5 per cent - having stood at 8.01 per cent. You are required to offer an explanation to the Treasury when this limit is violated; what will you be telling the Cabinet Secretary?\nThere were two significant drivers of that number. The first one is food prices. And there are eight items whose prices shot up from April last year: sukuma wiki, tomatoes, onions, avocado, Irish potatoes, carrots, cabbages and meat with bones.",

In the same period, the volume of tea sold at the Mombasa auction dropped to to 131.9 milliontonnes from 153 million in 2014 .\nAgriculture, Fisheries and Food Authority (AFFA) director-general Alfred Busolo said the outlook for the 2015/16 production year is promising and that the volume is likely to be maintained at the same level this financial year ending June.\n\"We expect that the export value of our tea will remain high in this financial year and this gives a promise of good earnings to our farmers,\" said Mr Busolo.\nIn 2014, tea farmers suffered a big blow as a market glut pulled down international prices, leaving Kenya with the lowest earnings in six years.\nThe tea year runs alongside that of government. A total of 240 million kgs of made tea was produced in the financial year 2014/2015 compared to 256 million kgs in 2013/2014.\nREAD: Strong dollar earns tea farmers Sh64 billion\nThe good prices witnessed last year saw growers affiliated to the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA) receive Sh28.7 billion in the second round of payment compared to the Sh19 billion earned in a similar period the previous year.\nKenya is the leading black tea exporter, selling over 400 million kilos to the world market annually, with only 25 million kilos of the beverage consumed locally.\nThe country exports 95 per cent of the tea produced locally making it the largest exporter of the beverage to the world market. This is unlike China, which is the leading producer of the commodity but consumes all its tea.\nData from the sector regulator, the Tea Directorate, indicates that consumption stood at 1.97 million kgs last year compared to 2.8 million kilogrammes registered during the same time in 2014.",

They not only know this, they believe it.\nThe second group believes that they will struggle through the year just as they did in 2015, and 2014 and 2013 and..because of exactly the same reasons their counterparts will thrive.\nThis second group believes their sales will improve when the price is lowered, their product or service matches the competition, the deliveries to distributors and all other processes operate with clockwork precision, and that 2016 remains sunny.\nAnd guess what?! Both groups are right. And they have the figures to prove it. Statistics are an amazing thing - they show you what you want them to.\nThe latter can show you their declining numbers from 2010 when they embraced this belief.\n\"See,\" they will explain, led by Shaka, \"every year the numbers have been going down because our prices have remained high and our product is inferior to the competition. You see this dip in Q4 2015? It was because of the El Nino rains; they interrupted our movements.\nAnd back office always delays to process payments (or create the website, or deliver the goods). These problems are the reasons for my declining numbers.\"\nGrowing numbers\nWhat about Ondati, Ndemo and Juma? How come their numbers are growing and you are in the same team? \"Arrgh! They are given leads. Back office favours them. They have cars and do not rely on public transport.\" Meantime Ndemo, how come your numbers are growing in spite of working in the same environment? \"Well, first I changed my company and enlarged my vision. I used to hang out with Shaka and his group until I realised that their belief was rubbing onto me.\n\"When I asked to understudy Ondati he was eager to help and my world changed dramatically. I used to complain about customer objections as the reason for not selling.\n\"Until Ondati showed me that these are few and can be handled. He even taught me what to say when they arise. A whole new world opened up for me; just knowing how to handle this one thing saw the problems of product, price and processes simply fall away.\nI couldn't believe it. All this time I was holding on to excuses not reasons. And as my sales started to increase I grew more positive, energetic, hopeful. I grew relationships with back office staff and when I request favours they grant them.\nNot all the time but often enough and always when they can. They even give me referrals which I'm sure to give them progress on. At one time I believed this job was impossible; now I believe it is the only job possible to experience this kind of personal growth. Look at these figures!

The current rains were mainly being witnessed in Nairobi, central highlands and the Ukambani region.\nThe meteorological official noted that the department will release weather forecast for the months of March April and May next month.\nIgad said last month that nearly 100 Kenyans have died as a result of El Nino rains with more than 70,000 people displaced, noting that the numbers were expected to rise in the coming months.\nIgad said that the impact of El Nino will persist into 2016, warning that Kenya will witness enhanced rainfall with high risk of flooding.\nThe deaths were caused by flash floods, lightening and landslides, with the agency warning that more than 1,460 families are at risk of mudslides in the highland areas in coming days.\nThe rains also affected people living in Internally Displace Persons camps (IDPs) leading to disease outbreaks in Kisumu, Tana River, Migori, Isiolo, Homa Bay and West Pokot.",

Activities of the construction industry recorded the fastest growth of 14.1 per cent,\" said KNBS director-general Zachary Mwangi in a statement.\nThe Treasury has steadily lowered the 2015 annual growth target from the original estimate of seven per cent, citing a range of factors, including higher costs of credit and the destructive El Nino rains. A lower growth outcome means the economy will not generate as many jobs as the Treasury had projected, confining the unemployed to more misery.\nThe statistics bureau attributed a 23.3 per cent jump in new bank credit - equivalent to Sh579 billion - as among the major factors that propelled overall growth in several sectors during the three months to end of September.\nThe agricultural sector expanded by 7.1 per cent from 6.8 per cent in the same quarter last year, reflecting the impact of the long rains recorded between March and May.\n\"The growth was supported by increase in the production of most major crops and the dairy sub-sector against a background of improved weather conditions,\" said the KNBS.\nConstruction - comprising new buildings, roads and rail - saw a frenetic activity, expanding by 14.1 per cent during the three months compared to 8.8 per cent in the same period last year.\nThe growth in construction was supported by increased credit to the sector, the statistics bureau said.\n\"The accelerated growth was mirrored in the increased credit advanced to the sector and cement consumption,\" said the KNBS.\nCredit advanced by commercial banks to the construction sector increased in the third quarter to Sh100.8 billion from Sh78.8 billion in 2014. The growth mirrored the trend in cement consumption, which increased by 10.7 per cent from 1.3 million metric tonnes in the third quarter of 2014 to 1.4 million metric tonnes in the same period this year.\nOther economic sectors that performed well during the quarter were transport and financial services. The real estate sector - measured in terms of rent earnings - was slower at 5.4 per cent compared to 6.2 per cent in the same quarter last year.\nJoseph Kieyah, an economist based at the Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA), said that the growth was consistent with the increase in consumption, investment and government spending in recent months.",

It also enables authorities to swiftly attend to the reported inconveniences.\n\"This idea was borne out the realisation that so many things happen in society, many of which the public are willing to report but lack knowledge or exact contacts of where to report. Even some of those who know or have the contacts don't have time to dedicate to report,\" says LocateIT managing director Erick Khamala.\n\"Perhaps it may require them to make calls to numbers that are perpetually busy hence difficult to go through or worse still long dead... There is also the other lot that are affected but don't care because they assume someone else will raise the alarm.\"\nM-Power currently runs on Android phones and will soon be available on iOS, Windows and BlackBerry phones. The app is meant to enable ordinary citizens interact with authorities without necessarily following the usual red tape.\n\"From the comfort of her mobile phone, Wanjiku can directly report to her governor the impassable section of the road to her local market or the collapsed bridge that has disconnected her from the only local dispensary.\n\"Within seconds of submission, the report reaches the governor on phone, tablet or computer via Twitter, email and SMS, tagging with it a photo and map showing the precise location of the reported matter,\" said Mr Khamala.\nPublic concerns about crime, accidents, disasters, power and water outages among others are submitted in a similar way, directly to concerned authorities such as police, disaster response agencies, power and water companies.\nMap the effects of El Nino\nAccadius Sabwa, co-owner and web programmer, says the app currently comprises two key features, MapIT and ReportIT, with additional functions still under development.",

In Uganda, Shebab bombers killed 76 people in restaurant attacks in 2010 in Kampala.\nIn CAR, the United Nations said it will move hundreds of peacekeepers from Ivory Coast to bolster security for both the pope's trip and national elections due in late December. CAR has been ensnared in civil war since 2013, with the country split between Muslim and Christian populations.\nThe situation remains volatile in the country - including in the capital Bangui where Francis is due to spend a little over 24 hours - and the insecurity may cause the CAR leg of the pope's Africa tour to be cancelled.\n\"We will see on the basis of the situation on the ground at the time whether we go ahead,\" Vatican official Pietro Parolin told Catholic newspaper Avvenire last week.\nSecurity nightmare\nPerhaps the trickiest moment for Kenyan security will come on Friday when Francis is due to visit Kangemi, a congested, tin-roofed slum on the outskirts of Nairobi that is home to some 200,000 people.\n\"Security will be a particularly important challenge,\" Kenya's Nation newspaper said in an editorial. \"Unlike President Obama's visit, this will be one in which hundreds of thousands will flock to the streets and the security services will need to be at the top of their game.\"\nKenya successfully hosted the US president for two days in July. But then Nairobi was locked down, residents were urged to stay home, US military helicopters buzzed overhead and armoured convoys carried Obama between heavily-guarded locations.\nFor the pope's visit, the situation will be very different.\n\"Unlike the visit by President Barack Obama when the government encouraged Kenyans to stay home, we are encouraging Kenyans to flock into the city in their numbers to cheer the pope and celebrate mass with him,\" said government spokesman Manoah Esipisu.",

        "text": "Treasury secretary Henry Rotich Wednesday announced new austerity measures, signalling that the government is yet to steer clear of the cash crisis it recently attributed to a shortfall in revenue collection.\nThe measures, involving deep cuts on non-essential budget items like travel, motor vehicle maintenance and conferencing, are expected to save taxpayers up to Sh4 billion and help ease the cash crunch in government.\nMr Rotich said he had issued a circular to accounting officers in all ministries asking them to cut expenditure plans to the bare minimum in an effort to plug budget holes caused by revenue shortfalls.\nTargeted items such as travel, hospitality and car maintenance cost Sh17.4 billion last year and Mr Rotich said he was looking at savings of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, translating to savings of up to Sh4 billion.\nThe austerity measures are expected to hit Members of Parliament and Members of County Assembly (MCAs), who consume the largest share of the government's travel budget, hardest.\n\"I have suspended benchmarking tours, at both national and county governments and expect domestic travel to be rationalised,\" said Mr Rotich during a public hearing on next year's budget.\nMedia companies, oil dealers and hoteliers - who have been hit hard by the tourism slump - are also expected to feel the heat as the government agencies go slow on advertising, motor vehicle repairs and hospitality spending. Mr Rotich said that savings from the austerity measures should help the government to lower its borrowing target of Sh222 billion.\nThe Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) collected Sh300 billion in the first three months of the financial year against a target of Sh328 billion, forcing the State to cut its expenditure plans. The shortfall was attributed to a slowdown in the economy arising from the increase in interest rates and depreciation of the shilling.\nMr Rotich also told Parliament that the Treasury had trimmed its economic growth expectations to 5.8 per cent from 6.0 per cent in October. The target stood at 6.5 per cent at the beginning of the year.\nREAD: Rotich cuts growth prospects citing tighter monetary policy, El Nino\n\"We are also going to the festive period but printing Christmas cards, calendars, T-shirts will not be entertained,\" Mr Rotich said.\nThe austerity measures are expected to be particularly painful for the hotel sector which has been relying on conferences and local tourism to stay afloat following a steep slump in foreign tourist arrivals in the past two years.\nPrevious announcements of expenditure cuts by the government have not yielded much, having been largely ignored by officials.\nREAD: Ministries defy Rotich as spending on travel, hospitality increases to Sh6bn",

The government had already downgraded its forecast to six per cent in October from the 6.5 to seven per cent it originally predicted.\nThe reduced economic activity looks set to dim corporate Kenya's ability to generate profits in what could ultimately depress companies' ability to hire more staff and up the wages of employees.\nOfficial data shows that Kenyan companies have trimmed their payrolls or kept them flat in the first quarter of the financial year that started July, worsening the labour market and slowing down tax revenues growth.\nThe revised forecast, however, means growth will still be higher than last year's 5.3 per cent and 4.7 per cent in 2013.\nKenya's economy has experienced turbulence resulting from budgetary shortfalls and a weaker shilling which has shed 13 per cent of its value to the US dollar since the beginning of the year to trade at 102.\nThe weakening of the local currency saw the Central Bank of Kenya raise its policy rate by three percentage points in June and July, signalling a higher cost of loans in order to tame inflation and strengthen the local unit.\nThe government's recent increased borrowing from the domestic market saw interest rates rise sharply, risking slowing down private sector activity.\nMr Rotich Wednesday said the economy's flagging fortunes will prompt a review of government spending and reduce borrowing. This will lead to budget cuts on non-essential items like travel, hotel conferences and car expenses.\n\"The measures will be reflected in the supplementary budget to be taken to Parliament soon,\" he told a press briefing in Nairobi.\nShilling\nThe World Bank last month also cut Kenya's 2015 growth projection to 5.4 per cent, lower than the previous estimate of six per cent, citing a volatile shilling, weak revenues and sluggish exports.\nREAD: Treasury, World Bank downgrade Kenya growth outlook\nThe ongoing El Nino rain has washed away several roads and cut off some rural areas in an agriculture-based economy.",

        "text": "Although Kenya has abundant water resources, both surface and ground, it is still classified as a water scarce county. This means that the amount of water available in the country is less than the demand.\nBut the problems affecting water resources is much more than just quantities available for the various needs. We have challenges relating to access, availability, distribution, quality and sustainability amongst many other problems.\nThis past week three I engaged in three events that brought to the fore the need for increased action to conserve our water by undertaking small but practical action. Two of these events were academic, the second practical.\nFirst I attended a debate organised by Law students at the University of Nairobi. I sat in a panel with two members of Parliament representing constituencies in Nairobi with large informal settlements.\nThe discussions revolved around realization of the Right to Water as guaranteed by the Constitution. The second event was the launch of a book titled \"Water is Life: Women's Human Rights in National and Local Water Governance in Southern and Eastern Africa\", a book co-edited by Professor Patricia Kameri-Mbote.\nMy last water related event for the week was getting stuck in traffic for two days as a result of the onset of the El Nino rains.\nIt is this last event more than the first two that got me thinking on the adequacy of our actions in ensuring that water is available for all the country's needs and people.\nAs I sat in my car with the rains pounding and run-off water flowing along the road, my mind went back to the preparations the Government put in place for the El Nino rains. It is just a few weeks ago when the media was awash with the amounts of money that had been budgeted by both national and county governments to respond to these rains.\nOur plans and policies talk of the need for harvesting rain water. As the rains pounded the country last week, my mind raced back to these budgets and could not recollect how much was set aside for improving our rain harvesting technologies. These would be better that the reported mosquito nets and soaps that had been budgeted for.\nOne does not need to be a rocket scientist to know that next year after the rains subside, we will have parts of this country experiencing spells of drought. As a country, will we regret not having harvested rain water during the El Nino period? Or is this connection too difficult to make?\nThe second practical measure relates to quality of water. During the panel discussions referred to above, a student asked us why there was an unprecedented increase in the number of companies producing and selling bottled water in the county and what the Kenya Bureau of Standards could do to ensure that such water were of high quality. In reflecting on this concern, I went back ten years ago.\nOne will readily notice that the numbers of companies bottling water has increased tremendously. Before the mineral water sold used to have a label to the effect that they were bottled at source. The assumption was that this was from a natural spring hence its purity.\nWhile regulation of water bottling should be tightened, we have to ensure that the agencies responsible for supplying water to the public can guarantee and convince Kenyans that tap water is safe to drink. In several developed states, tap water is safe to drink. It is only by doing this that we will ensure sanity in the bottling of water.\nThe third issue relates to the provisions of Article 43 (1) (d) of the Constitution, which guarantees every Kenyan clean and safe water in adequate quantities.\nIt is time that the recent reform effort, including the current debate on a new Water law ensure support to practical measures to meet the water needs of Kenyans.",

        "text": "Today, only 40 per cent of the Jubilee administration's electoral term remains. Yet instead of showcasing its achievements thus far, it is the cash crunch in government that continues to grab the headlines, raising more questions than answers.\nExperience tells us that the core pledges of any administration usually begin to come to fruition around the mid-term, while failed promises are relegated to a distant memory.\nDespite its short term, the Jubilee administration persists with the 'PR' stunt - of being digital versus analogue.\nWhat the current cash crunch has unveiled however is the reality of a debt-fuelled mega-project investment binge, profligate and wasteful spending frenzy at national and county government levels and fast-growing (outside the office) wholesale and (within the office) retail corruption amid a growing realisation that Jubilee's ICC-focused first year was effectively, Kenya's lost year.\nKenya's first-ever Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy - launched in 2014 - is already 'dead in the water'. This strategy was built around a 60:40 domestic to external borrowing ratio.\nIt emphasised public financing through medium to long-term Treasury bonds over short-term Treasury bills (T-bills), and concessionary over commercial external lending.\nHowever today's reality is that T-bills rule for now while syndicated loans and cheap foreign money are the 'new black'.\nInternational rating agencies Fitch's and Standard & Poor's - who provided the sovereign rating underpinning the now controversial 2014 Eurobond - have downgraded Kenya from \"stable\" to \"negative\".\nS&P's estimates that Kenya's debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio will be as high as 60 per cent in 2016 - slowing GDP growth, rising debt - from a little over 50 per cent in June. And what of the GDP itself? Two points are clear.\nFirst, the false promise. Jubilee's manifesto was never going to deliver 10 per cent GDP growth. It lacked a truly coherent and philosophical core to its many, and admittedly very clever initiatives.\nMoreover it overestimated the capacity of the current bureaucracy to implement its multiple ideas.\nSecondly, the reality. GDP growth fell from 5.7 per cent in 2013 to 5.3 per cent in 2014. And now the half-year growth pegged at around 5.2 per cent, factored with the limited productive government spending since July and El Nino rains just starting, it will truly be a surprise if GDP growth exceeds 4.9 per cent in 2015.\nBut coming back to the current cash crunch, fears about its impact are increasingly widespread. This week alone, two private sector groups-the Kenya Association of Manufacturers and the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry - expressed concerns - respectively - about the impact on private sector job retention, and the effect of the high interest rates on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs).\nThe question is what this means for ordinary Kenyans. Let's look at two extreme scenarios.",

        "text": "The October rains are finally here, or is it the onset of the El Nino? Well, there are certain things garden owners should keep in mind during this rainy season.\nPius Mwambingu, a Landscape Architect at Landtek Studios, says there are seven guided processes for one to follow in order to achieve that healthy-looking mature garden during this period.\nThe most sensitive of all, Mwambingu says, is the garden drainage.\nMost people over look drainage thinking that the garden should naturally \"swallow up\" its waters, but it is important to direct the water, he says.\n\"Drainage ensures that water does not flow back into your house and that's why ground levelling is important to direct water away from the house,\" said Mwambingu adding that it is important to have your garden done professionally from the start to avoid possible disasters.\nThe landscaper says that this is the time to identify the stubborn weeds and uproot them manually from your garden. Failure to do this results in overgrown weeds which end up killing the shrubs and plants.\nHe, however, advises against the use of artificial weed killers as they will affect the health of your garden.\nIf you have a natural lawn, then this is the time to maintain the look. Top dressing should be done as part of the lawn care.\n\"It is advisable to use a mixture of soil and farm manure during the rainy season to enrich your soil again. Top dressing also helps to fill in the gaps underground created by roots and the rain helps in the filling,\" he says.\nIt is not advisable to use fertilizer because overuse supplies nitrogen in excess hence ending up destroying your plants. The expert, however says, that in cases where farm manure is not readily available fertiliser can be used in small quantities.\nHe also advises that lawns should be redone and renovated after every five years, for a fresh look.\nThe ground naturally compacts over time that's why it is important to dig it up and open more space for water filtration. This do-it-yourself process can be done using a fork jembe or hand-fork.\nPruning should also be done for on all levels of plants namely; ground covers (about 200 millimetres tall aboveground), bedding plants ( about 750 millimetres high) and shrubs (can go up to 1.5 meters high) and trees.\nHe said that pruning gives a chance for fresh leaves to grow and since the rate of growth during the rainy season is rapid, the method can help maintain the leaves.",

But is this discussion enough?\nIs flooding, destruction of crops and infrastructure all there is to the El Nino debate? Certainly not. And this is where we are getting it wrong.\nTrue, preparedness should inform our conversations and action, but so should our ability to take advantage of any silver lining such phenomena pose. For El Nino is not all about doom and gloom for our farmers.\nIn fact according to a research released last year on the impacts of El Nino and La Nina on global food production, El Nino has had a positive impact on crop yields in 30 to 36 per cent of harvested regions.\nSoya bean, one of the crops under study, recorded a 4.5 per cent jump in yields during El Nino years than normal times.\nIn some of the relatively dry areas in America, El Nino is usually seen as the 'great wet hope' with the rains associated with breaking the searing drought.\nWith the forecasting of such phenomena becoming more accurate, scientists in most of these countries are now moving to training the people mostly affected on resilience for example agronomic adaptation for farmers. There is no reason why we shouldn't embrace it here.\nAlready farmers have cleared their farms off any produce in anticipation of the heavy rains. With the weather man having predicted that the rains will on average last for three months, what happens to farms in those three months?\nAlternative crops that can withstand the heavy rains and floods are limitless. Plants like bananas and napier grass have been known to withstand an above normal supply of water.\nHaving them in farms as the farmers await the rains to subside would make economic sense in a country that has over the recent past decried dwindling pasture for livestock which has set in motion a catalogue of devastating events including depressed earnings from livestock farmers and disposal of livestock at throw away prices.\nAnd then there is the question of water conservation and harvesting, an all too familiar phrase that has been recited by virtually anyone but one which we have nothing to show for.",

While they clearly bring many benefits contributing to economic growth, adverse malaria impacts need to be addressed or they will undermine the sustainability of Africa's development,\" said the study's lead author, Solomon Kibret, a biologist at the University of New England in Australia.\nEl Nino rains\nThe study undertaken by the CGIAR Research Programme on Water, Land and Ecosystems looked at 1,268 dams in sub-Saharan Africa. Of these, just under two-thirds, or 723, were in malaria zones.\nKibret stated that the results show that the population around dams at risk of malaria is at least four times greater than previously estimated.\n\"Dams are an important option for governments anxious to develop,\" says Matthew McCartney of the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and a co-author of the paper.\n\"But it is unethical that people living close to them pay the price of that development through increased suffering and loss of life due to disease.\"\nAs mosquito populations peak during rainy seasons when water levels rise in water bodies, the Health ministry will be monitoring these areas as the El Nino rains pound the country.\nAside from malaria, Dr Nicholas Muraguri, Kenya's director of Medical Services, has warned that outbreaks of other water related diseases like Dengue and Rift Valley Fever could also increase.",

        "text": "A man hawks handbags in Nairobi. Traffic jams are a hawker's paradise.\nHawking must be the most effective sales distribution system in Kenya, if not Africa. Yet, its full potential is yet to be tapped. If anything, it's being fought. This is because hawking is misunderstood and, as such, conjures up negative connotations of desperation.\nHence the often sarcastic rejoinder: \"We cannot be seen to be hawking our products.\" But what is hawking? Is it not personal selling? And isn't personal selling the crux of all sales?\nAnd what makes hawking so effective? First, hawkers offer close, one-to-one attention in an informal environment. Much like missionary work and dating. And see how effective those are.\nNo chest-thumping expensive adverts; just quiet effective heart-to-heart moments. Long lasting connections (and therefore sustainable relationships) are created in these moments.\nMake lemonade\nAlso, seeing as life gives us lemons in the name of incessant traffic jams, instead of complaining why not make lemonade? This way, the phrase \"I'll buy it in traffic\", will be in vogue. See, while we complain about traffic, hawkers (and radio stations) rejoice in it.\nProspecting is the lifeline of the salesman. On the other hand, traffic jams are a hawker's paradise.\nYou and I know that snarl-ups aren't leaving our major towns any time soon. If you can't beat them, join them. For instance, hundreds of cars ply Mombasa Road, in Nairobi, every morning with traffic stretching for kilometres.\nNow, if you were in a branded apron and hat of a renowned bookshop selling pencils and exercise books the week before schools open, how many parents would happily roll down their car windows to buy from you?\nYou will have helped them manage time better. Thirdly, when traffic eases hawkers prospect elsewhere; petrol stations being their favourite spots, followed by residential estates.\nHawkers also target areas which are easy to reach in major towns. The ease of accessing such places with little to no cost reduces the cost of sales significantly.\nHave you noticed how hawkers know just what to sell and when? Right now you would be hard pressed to find an umbrella or rechargeable emergency light gadget on sale on streets.\nSoon the long awaited El Nino rains will strike and viola, the streets will be swamped by hawkers peddling umbrellas. Finally, the labour intensive hawking method is helping solve Kenya's crippling youth unemployment problem.\nOf course not all products can be hawked. This does not stop one from innovating though.",

FILE\nThe Treasury has directed ministries to prepare initial proposals for budget cuts in readiness for predicted El Nino rains.\nCabinet Secretary Henry Rotich also asked county governments to set aside funds under their emergency votes to mitigate effects of the devastating long rains.\nHe said the ministry has held meetings with ministries and county governments that are likely to be affected most to prepare for the phenomenon.\n\"I have asked ministries to prepare a restructuring of their budget in event of any eventuality. Ministries like that of roads have to prepare for this El-Nino. They must start to prioritise the unlocking and unblocking of water system,\" he told the national assembly Public Accounts Committee.\nMr Rotich was hard pressed to explain why the Treasury found it easy to side Sh5 billion to mitigate effects of the El Nino rains yet it cannot raise money to pay teachers to implement a 50 to 60 per cent pay rise as directed by the courts.\nREAD: Farmers seek cash for early harvest to curb El Nino\nTeachers have gone on strike from August 31 demanding the implementation of the salary award in a dispute that has seen the government order the closure of schools.\nMr Rotich said the magnitude of the teacher's award was not foreseen in the current budget.\nEXTRA MILE\n\"In budgeting, we depend on what was foreseen and unforeseen. It is tight for us to even respond to El Nino funding. We have gone extra mile to discuss with county governments, ministries and donors.\n\"We are not looking at additional funding but reorganisation of the budget whose scope is tight. Huge financing has to be programmed clearly going forward. Restructuring the budget midway is almost impossible looking at the teacher's budget,\" he said.\nPAC chairman Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda) and Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire demanded to know where the government is getting Sh5 billion for the rains and not money to pay teachers.\nSuba MP John Mbadi challenged Treasury saying the budget can be rearranged as was the case last year when the House increased it by a further Sh190 billion through supplementary budget.\n\"Kenyans have a have a right to ask the amount of money allocated to El Nino, where it is coming from and what measures the government is taking to ensure prudent use of emergency funds to avoid side stepping of procedures during emergencies,\" Gumbo said.",

The national grain handler however only accepts maize with moisture content of 13.5 per cent.\n\"This means that a farmer has to spend a lot more resources before the moisture level of his crop is achieved,\" said Mr Chumo.\nAflatoxin usually attacks grains that have not been properly dried. The fungus which develops on grain exposed to excess moisture, has been linked to liver cancer.\nCases of aflatoxin are high in Kenya and thousands of people, especially in the countryside fall victim of this menace because the flour that they grind in the local posho mills does not undergo testing. In the 2004 outbreak alone, it killed at least 100 people in Kenya.\nThe cereals board currently charges Sh22 and Sh34 for every drop in moisture content for a 50 kilogramme bag of maize and 90kg bag respectively.\nThe North Rift region yields approximately 11 million bags of maize and 5.4 bags of wheat every year.\nMaize harvesting in the region begins in late October (during which the heavy rains are expected) and runs until December. Wheat farmers, whose crops are expected to mature in the next two months, fear they will bear the biggest brunt of the unprecedented rains.",

For many Catholics, the Pope's message brought a new voice to the climate war that threatens to deal harsh blows to the world.\n\"The powerful of the Earth\" like the US will answer to God if they fail to protect the environment to ensure the world can feed its population, the Pope said.\nThe Kenyans joined the cause and have been fasting for climate change for more than a month now, joining Christians around the world who started giving up sugar, coffee or junk food during the Lent period in February.\nThe young Kenyans under the Africa Fast for Climate and Founder of Green Sun Cities have given up food as a call for action on climate change. The Lent period is over but for the over 300 Kenyan climate change campaigners, the fasting continues.\n\"We started fasting for the climate in August for 61 days. We want to send a message to the government that people from all walks of life, faiths and creeds expect climate action,\" said Benedict Muyale, the co-ordinator on Africa Fast for Climate and Founder of Green Sun Cities-an initiative for climate change in cities. Mr Muyale, 30, says ''taking action on climate change is indispensable to faith.''\nThe end of their fast will not coincide with the coming of Pope Francis to Kenya in November, but they hope their voice would have been heard.\nThe pontiff will visit Kenya on November 25, before travelling to Uganda on November 27 and arriving in the Central African Republic, the final stop on the trip, on November 29.\nThe Kenyans are joining thousands of global protesters who are pushing their governments to act on global warming.\nFrom protesters dressed as polar bears, or chaining themselves to the northern runway at Heathrow and causing a 13-hour-long delay and cancellations for air passengers, to those with green leaves attached to their heads, the call to cut greenhouse emissions and slow down oil exploration is turning into a contagion.\nKenya and its regional neighbours have already starting feeling the effects of global warming. Kenya just like Uganda is experiencing unpredictable rainy seasons.\n\"The adverse effects of climate change is evident. What else are we waiting for to act? The Maasais are grazing their cattle in the streets of Nairobi portraying that they can no longer handle the adverse climatic changes in their land, hence their search for greener pastures for their animals,'' said Mr Muyale.\nThe Metrological Department has warned of a looming months-long El Nino. The heavy rains are set to hit the economy hard, wreaking havoc on food crop. Flooding is also expected to increase animal and human diseases and pests.\nIn Uganda, coffee production is under a threat as coffee rust, a leaf disease that was common in warm areas, spreads to new cold regions. Malaria has also spread to newer regions.",

        "text": "This past week the Kenya Meteorological Department issued a weather alert that the annual short rains season from October to December would be enhanced due to the El Nino phenomenon.\nThe term has been used in weather circles to refer to a period associated with a band of warm ocean water, and low and high air pressure in the Pacific. And while El Nino's origin is in the Pacific, its manifestation is experienced across the world.\nBecause Kenya will be receiving increased rainfall, it's important to appreciate the double-edged impact on the economy and society.\nOn the plus side, the rains will be a boost to the agricultural sector that was in the grips of a dry spell at the beginning of the year. As a result, yields are expected to be bountiful.\nThe heavy rains will also help mitigate the country's chronic water shortage. Majority of Kenyans do not have adequate supply of water hence rainwater harvesting taps the commodity for both domestic and industrial uses.\nThere have been efforts to improve this process through adoption of different technologies that would spell an end to water scarcity. However, we must appreciate that the onset of El Nino rains is normally associated with disasters and destruction.\nEarly this year, the towns of Narok and Nairobi were in the news after being pounded by heavy rains. The streets of Narok were flooded, leading to loss of lives, ruined businesses and damaged property.\nThe Nairobi-Bomet-Kisii road was cut off as vehicles were swept away. In Nairobi, the heavy rain led to traffic gridlock with motorists spending the night in their cars, collapsed walls and buildings, and several deaths.\nOne of the lingering images is that of a school bus with children in it stuck on a flooded road at midnight.\nThe county government responded by sending out teams to unblock clogged storm drainage systems. Now that we have prior warning of the impending heavy rains, it is important that we evaluate our preparedness and response strategies.\nFor far too long this country has raised the need for a disaster management policy and clear response measures. Just this year alone the country has witnessed several disasters.\nHowever, when crises occur one cannot help but notice the duplicity in government's response. In other instances the reaction is too little too late.\nA properly designed strategy would help us stop reacting to disasters. The public also ought to appreciate the link between the El Nino rains, disaster response and environmental conservation. In many instances, calls for environmental conservation are disregarded at the altar of development pursuit.\nThe argument made is that to develop, some harm to the environment will have to occur, or that the economic benefits to be derived from such development outweighs the environmental destruction.",

PHOTO | JEFF ANGOTE | NATION MEDIA GROUP\nCity Hall has set aside a Sh50 million emergency recovery fund for clearing blocked drains in a bid to avert a repeat of flooding and power blackouts experienced on Monday and Tuesday.\nThis came as the Devolution ministry also deployed thousands of recently graduated National Youth Service personnel to unclog the city's drains.\n\"This cash will be used largely to clear and unblock clogged drainage channels and to re-construct road works that have been destroyed by the rains,\" said Nairobi infrastructure executive Mohamed Abdullahi.\nDevolution secretary Anne Waiguru ordered the immediate deployment of the 10,000 servicemen who are still in camps following an inspection of damage caused by Tuesday's downpour.\n\"This is a short-term measure to offer reprieve to commuters and motorists,\" she said. The servicemen will be assisted by 2,000 youths from Fuata Nyayo slum who will also be hired to assist with clearing the drains.\nTuesday's floods left thousands of homes in Nairobi without power after two substations were submerged in a heavy downpour that also flooded multiple roads.\nREAD: Heavy rain, flooding cause havoc in Nairobi\nIn a statement, Kenya Power said that the substations located in Nairobi West and Karen (near Bomas of Kenya) were switched off to protect equipment from possible damage and for safety reasons.\nThousands of commuters also spent hours on congested roads with many cars trapped by the rising floods.\nA Makini School bus with children on board stalled near the South C Mosque and was almost swept away by raging waters that followed a two-hour downpour.\nA statement from Governor Evans Kidero who cut his trip to Doha short blamed heavier-than-expected rains for the flooding, adding that the county is doing all it can to clear the drains.\n\"It is worthy to note that the rains we are currently experiencing are higher by 10 per cent vis a vis rainfall received last year around this time. This is worse than the El Nino rains experienced in Nairobi in 1997,\" he said.\nMost city residents have, however, pointed out that the flooding is mainly caused by the inadequate drainage system and people who were allowed to build on waterways by City Hall and the National Environment Management Authority (Nema).\n\"In the long term, Nairobi County needs to address encroachment of riparian land and storm flood plains,\" Ms Waiguru said.",

        "text": "WHERE YOU LIVE has a profound impact on your skin.\n It is important to take these factors into account when selecting your skin care regime.\nThis is because your skin \"reacts\" differently when in different areas in Kenya. There are places where your skin behaves well, whereas in others, pimples breakout. Here are tips to follow depending on where you live:\nEquatorial high altitude: The cool weather in central highlands is mild to the skin, but the proximity to the equator means that there is more exposure to the sun's UV rays. The skin ages faster if you live in these areas. The cold night air causes windburn, characterised by darkening of the eye area. Care: Wear sunscreen during the day. Avoid the use of skin lighteners because they compound the problems. Use rich, protective creams or natural oils at night.\nPolluted areas: If you live in Nairobi and other industrial towns, constant emissions from cars and factories result in a layer of grime forming on the skin which clogs the pores. Care: Proper cleansing of the skin is key. This should be followed by the use of protective products such as sunscreen and anti-ageing creams.\nHot and dusty areas: Heat causes sweating and warmth in the skin, a perfect breeding ground for fungi which gives rise to rashes. A dusty environment causes a build up of grime and dirt. Care: Wear loose, cotton clothing and keep the skin clean and dry at all times. Use products with sunscreen and take plenty of water. The face may be kept clean by frequent swiping with facial wet wipes.",

        "text": "Ever since Mary Onyango relocated to Kisumu from Nyeri last year, she feels \"mentally disturbed and my face is losing its glow\". And she is convinced it is because there are fewer trees in Kisumu.\nThere could be some truth to her words, strange as it might sound: a report published last year by Stanford University in California shows that people who spend time outside in green, natural spaces tend to be healthier and happier than those who do not and it is well known that trees purify the air by absorbing carbon dioxide.\nNotably, Nyeri County has 10 times the number of trees in Siaya, Migori, Homa Bay and Kisumu counties combined. In Nyeri County, 38.03 per cent of the land is covered with trees, according to a 2015 mapping of forest cover report by the Kenya Forestry Service (KFS). This means that Siaya County, with only 0.42 per cent, would have to plant 90 times the numbe of trees Nyeri has to attain that green ambience.\nWith tree covers of 0.42 (Kisumu), 2.62 (Kisii) and 2.59 (Homa Bay) are not doing any better.\nThese four counties, plus Busia County, have the lowest tree cover in the country while Nyeri, Elgeyo-Marakwet (37.49), Lamu (33.9) and Baringo (25.12) have the highest.\nWith a tree cover of 7.29 per cent, Nyamira is the only county in Nyanza that exceeds the national average of 7.14 per cent.\nGiven these low figures, environmental experts now warn that the residents of Nyanza have a reason to worry.\nDr David Langat, the deputy regional director at the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (Kefri) in charge of the lake Victoria Basin - which covers the former Nyanza and Western provinces - says serious deforestation has taken place.\nHe singles out Gwasi as an area that was once forested but has lost many of its trees to human settlement.\nThe residents of Gwasi also talk of two forest fires that gutted 5 hectares of Ramoya and 12 hectares of Kigwa blocks of Gwasi Forest.\nA 2006 International Forestry Resources Institution report put the estimated deforestation rate at 200 hectares a year not just in Gwasi, but in the whole of Western and Nyanza regions.\nKefri's current estimates put the little pockets of trees left at just 12,000 hectares.\nIn Ndhiwa Constituency, trees have been cut not only for traditional construction, but also for the booming brick-making business, which requires a lot of wood for kilning.\nIn addition, the local people rely heavily on wood fuel, which encourages charcoal burning.\nKanyikela area Member of County Assembly in Ndhiwa Sylvance Wanjala told DN2 that a brick costs Sh6, and a simple, one-bedroom house requires more than 3,000 bricks.\n\"It is booming business, and those prices will shoot up really soon,\" he said.\nSo serious has the deforestation been that the National Museums of Kenya stepped in and took control of the Thim Lich Ohinga Forest, which straddles Ndhiwa in Homa Bay County and Nyatike in Migori.\nWhile the situation is changing, Dr Langat says, it will take long due to the people's attitude.\n\"Here, people believe trees just grow on their own, so they will cut down a tree with no plans of replacing what they have cut and when they plant, they wait for the tree to thrive on its own,\" he offered.\nBut the apathy with which people view trees is not unique to Nyanza.\nDr Wanja Kinuthia, an entomologist at the National Museums of Kenya in Nairobi who has studied the role of plants in sustaining pollinators, had told DN2 in an earlier interview that, coupled with the apathy that most Kenyans have towards nature, the science of how one tree can affect their lives is difficult to grasp.\n\"Sometimes people plant trees alright, but they choose the wrong species that end up making 'dead forests' because they are the types that do not encourage life underneath them and impoverish the soil instead of enriching it,\" she said.\nThe link between human wellbeing and trees is a concept that many ordinary Kenyans fully understand.\nNoting that trees absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, Dr Lang'at said Nyanza will have to battle the negative effects of climate change as it tackles urbanisation, thanks to its poor tree cover.\nMrs Lorna Omuodo, the chief officer for Renewable Energy and Climate Change, pointed out that Kisumu, more than any other county in the region, will continue experiencing increased termperatures and prolonged rains due to the high amounts of methane gas in the air.\nSpeaking during the realease of a report on the gender perspective to climate change by Practical Action and Institute of Development Studies, she attributed the dangerously high levels of methane to the careless disposal of organic waste by residents.\n\"It is littered everywhere, and this gas is warming the county aggressively,\" Mrs Omuodo said.\nMethane, which is produced when plant and animal waste decomposes, is \"20 times more potent\" than carbon monoxide, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.\nMethane stays in the atmosphere for a maximum of 12 years and has a direct impact on human health.\nWhile Mrs Omuodo did not say by exactly what margin the temperature would rise, but her fears are not unfounded, going by data from the Kenya Meteorological Department and studies. Besides, while collecting data for her thesis at Kenyatta University in 2014, Millicent Ochieng', an environmental science Masters student, found that temperatures in Kisumu rose by an average of 0.66 degrees Celsius every month from 1972 to 2011.\nThe data, collected at Kisumu Weather Station Number 9034025, also indicated that the rains increased by 115 millilitres during that period.\nKisumu residents frequently complain of the heat and erratic rainfall patterns, which climate change experts attribute to the release of greenhouse gases such as methane into the air, among other factors.\nThe reason this is likely to affect Kisumu more than the other counties, she said, was the rapid industrialisation.\n\"There is no known structure that explains what happens to all the leftover food from these hotels, supermarkets and houses that are built in this city every day.\nAdd to that the market days in Sondu, Awach, Ahero and other places.. where does all that waste go?\" she wondered.\nIndeed, Kisumu remains the biggest economic powerhouse in the region, with a population of 952,000, according to the 2014 economic survey. She singled out the sites that should \"give people sleepless nights\" as \"Behind Kibuye Market where people keep molasses, the slaughter house in Mamboleo, and the Kachok dumpsite.\"\nIn the 2015 last quarter report by the weathermen, a write-up by James Kongoti, the director of the Meteorological Department, warned that the counties in the western region would experience \"highly enhanced rainfall\".\nAnd sure enough. Kisumu recorded 775m, which was double the usual amount (113 per cent).\nBut lack of trees does not lead only to the retention of high levels of methane in the atmosphere. Cutting trees releases stored carbon dioxide that had already been absorbed back to the atmosphere, contributing to further heating.\nThus the increasing temperatures in Nyanza cannot be blamed solely on of the low forest cover.\nJohanes Onyango, who lives near Ranen Forest in Rongo, likes it because it receives rainfall, when the adjacent areas such as Rakwaro are dry. The elderly man cites Kaksengere, Mbaga and the Kanyamwa escarpment as places he would not mind living in because they, too, receive rain when the other areas are dry.\nNotably, they are all heavily forested.\n\"I think these trees just bring rain,\" he says, unaware of the complex science behind his observation.\nThis is the concept of \"flying rivers\", which says that trees take up moisture from the soil through their roots, and release that water into the atmosphere through their leaves.\nThe plants also have volatile compounds called terpenes and isoprenes.\nIn fact, it is estimated that a tree in a rich ecosystem such as the Amazon or Congo forest releases 1,000 litres of water vapour into the atmosphere every day. And it is this vapour that creates clouds. The vapour \"matures\" thanks to the activity of the volatile terpenes and isoprene. With the help of winds, these water-carrying clouds can travel further than the eye can see, hence the name \"flying rivers\".\nThese rivers move over water bodies collecting more moisture until they bump into each other at some point and bring rain.\nThough the dynamics are not well understood, there is also the term \"biotic pumping\", used by authors like Jim Robbins, who wrote the book, The Man who Planted Trees.",

        "text": "Kenya's business climate will this year continue to suffer from sentiments associated with terrorist attacks, corruption, a shaky judiciary and upcoming general elections.\nControl Risks, a global business risk consultancy firm, says these will be the key challenges all businesses need to factor in as they chart their plans for the year.\nThe \"RiskMap 2016\" report also highlights some of the most significant trends in global risk, as well as political and security concerns that private and public organisations need to be aware of in 2016.\nThe firm's senior managing director for East Africa, Mr Daniel Heal, said terrorism ranks among the five top risks of doing business not only in Kenya but globally.\n\"Terrorism is a risk that is not going away. The actual terror attacks aside, a major concern to businesses is the threat of these attacks which has the effect of deterring foreign investors from entry, investment or partnership with Kenya or Kenyan companies,\" Mr Heal said.\nREAD: Eurobond 'noise' may raise Kenya's risk profile\nThe report says Kenya will suffer from a fruitless anti-graft campaign carried out in all sectors, including from government and the opposition. There will be little or no cultural shift nor a decrease in the prevalence of corruption.\nConsequently, the politicisation of the anti-graft narrative is increasing momentum ahead of the 2017 elections, meaning that any prosecution of graft perpetrators would be perceived to be politically skewed.\nPOLITICAL DYNAMICS\nThe report anticipates that both national and regional elections will be hotly contested in 2017 and likely to result in a recurrence of electoral malfeasance, including the likelihood of recruitment of youth gangs and militias.\nCompanies are also likely to come under pressure to meet local demands for benefits like employment. This might play out at the national and county levels, exposing the businesses to a more complex environment than before.\nThe report, however, says that for cross border businesses, risk will be low because the threat from piracy has subsided.\n\"Though Somali piracy remains in the headlines, in reality it has gone quiet. After several years as the primary maritime security issue, activity off the coast of Somalia by late 2015 had fallen to just 1 per cent of its 2011 high point and the trend is positive.",

        "text": "However, discrepancies in the regional figures clearly indicate that a lot more needs to be done.\nAccording to the Demographic Survey 2014 released last month, Kenya has made remarkable strides in the war against infant mortality in the last two decades.\nBy VERAH OKEYO\nMore by this Author\nAt Bondo District Hospital in Siaya County, Susan Amondi is rocking the older of her two children, one-and-a half year-old Onyango while his five-month-old brother, chuckles as he clings to her.\nThe nurse in charge tells DN2 that Onyango is suffering from malnutrition - and a host of other infections - and that their mother had to come with both of them when he was admitted because there was no one to look after the younger child.\nMeanwhile, miles away at the Kiambu District Hospital in Kiambu County, eight-month-old Mary is also admitted and being looked after by her mother. She is suffering from a blood infection (sepsis).\nA brief chat with the two women clearly indicates that they do not understand the ailments afflicting their children. And they are equally unaware of the bleak - or bright - future their geographical locations mean for their children's survival.\nWhile Susan is optimistic that her son will survive the sickness that has kept them in this hospital for more than three weeks, recent statistics show little Mary in Kiambu is more likely to live to see her fifth birthday than Onyango.\nAccording to the Demographic Survey 2014, which was launched this year, certain regions in the country ensure better child survival than others, going by the diseases that claim children's lives, as well as the medical seeking behaviour by parents of guardians, which also determine the survival of children.\nNyanza, Nairobi and Western are the least favourable regions for a child to grow up in while Central and North-Eastern are the best.\nFor instance, for every 1,000 live births in Nyanza, 82 will die, compared with only 42 in Central.\nNairobi comes second, with 72 deaths out of every 1,000 live births, followed by Western with 64 per cent.\nThese data mars the country's otherwise good record.\nAccording to a United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) report in 2014, Kenya had managed to significantly reduce mortality in children below the age of five.\nFor instance, in 2003, there were 115 deaths per 1,000 live births, but this number had been reduced to 52 by 2014.\nThe report attributed this reduction to improved medical care seeking behaviour, as well as using maternal healthcare services and delivering in proper health facilities.\nIt is worth noting that the deliveries in public health hospitals almost trebled after the President Uhuru Kenyatta announced in June 2013 that maternity services would be free at these facilities.\nKnowledge and proper medical seeking behaviour of mothers on infectious diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhoea also contributed positively to the reduction in child mortality.\nYet the latest demographic survey highlights regional discrepancies that stand in stark contrast the impressive general indicators.\nNyanza and Western scored poorest in managing the diseases that claim children's lives, namely malaria, acute respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases.\nSevere diarrhoea, which causes dehydration, has been implicated in many studies by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a major cause of sickness and mortality among young children.\nFigures from Migori County indicated that 27.9 per cent of children in the area - the highest in the country - had suffered from diarrhoea.\nThis statistic is alarming as it is not only high, but also a pointer that the number of children who had stool with traces of blood, an indicator of the life-threatening strains of bacterial diarrhoea, were high.\nVihiga County recorded the second highest number of children who had suffered from diarrhoea with 23.6 per cent, followed closely by Homa Bay with 23.5 per cent.\nMandera, County recorded the fewest cases of diarrhoea, with 5 per cent, while Nyamira and Nyeri recorded 3 per cent each.\nThe Homa Bay County Executive for Health, Dr Lawrence Oteny, told DN2 that cases of water-borne diseases have remained \"stubbornly\" high because the latrine and toilet coverage in the area was still low, with seven for every 10 homes.\nHe added that poverty was a contributing factor to the poor toilet coverage.\n\"The soil in these areas is not stable, therefore digging latrines in homesteads is a challenge when the families are poor and cannot afford to pay for the construction,\" he said.\nIndeed, the demographic survey reported that: \"Diarrhoea is less common among children who used improved, private toilet facilities (11 per cent) than among those who use non-improved or shared improved facilities (16 per cent)\"\nFEVER\nAnother childhood disease listed was fever, which is a sign of either malaria or other life-threatening infections.\nThe survey reported that Nyanza recorded the highest cases of fever in children, with 37 per cent, closely followed by Western with 36 per cent.\nPneumonia, an acute respiratory infection (ARI), and one of whose symptoms is also fever, remains the country's leading killer of children under five.\nNyanza and Western reported the highest cases of children who had suffered from ARIs, standing at 9.7 per cent and 12.8 per cent respectively.\nThe counties with the highest percentages of children with symptoms of ARI were Vihiga (17 per cent), Bungoma (16 per cent), Baringo (14 per cent) Homa Bay and Migori (13 per cent).\nMandera recorded the lowest levels of ARIs with 2 per cent while Turkana, Garissa, Kisumu, Kirinyaga, and Nyamira, registered three 3 per cent each.\nNotably, the counties with the highest cases of ARIs used firewood and charcoal as a primary source of energy for domestic use. Interestingly, studies have implicated the use of firewood in the relationship between indoor pollution and respiratory illnesses.\nVaccination\nRemarkably, despite the discouraging statistics from Nyanza and Western the two regions performed quite well in public health interventions such as vaccinations.\nAccording to WHO guidelines, a child is considered to have received all the basic vaccinations after being inoculated against the following diseases: tuberculosis, which is also known as BCG; three doses each of the DPT-HepB-Hib, which prevents diphtheria; whooping cough (pertussis); tetanus, also referred to as pentavalent; polio; and measles.\nThe vaccination coverage in Nyanza stood at 77 per cent while in Western, it was 81.\nNorth Eastern performed the worst in this regard, with 55 per cent of the children there having been vaccinated.\nCentral maintained the lead, with 90.3 per cent of the children having access to all the vaccines. In fact, 97 per cent of the children in Kiambu County had received all the necessary vaccinations.\nOf all the counties that make up Nyanza- Migori, Homa Bay, Siaya, Kisumu, Kisii and Nyamira- Homa Bay and Migori County had the worst indicators in the region, scoring the lowest on vaccination coverage, but the highest in Diarrhoeal diseases, ARIs and fever.\nWHY THE DIFFERENCES?\nSeveral explanations, both expert and layman, have been advanced to explain why the different regions record such widely differing figures.\nOn that is often cited is climate.\nWhile the public health departments in the regions doing poorly can be blamed in part for not containing pandemics, Nyanza and Western are also climatically disadvantaged.\nWHO classifies the two regions - as well as the Coast- as \"malaria endemic\". Their location in low altitude areas, which range from 0 to 1,300 metres above sea level, makes it easy for malaria to spread.\nMalaria, a disease caused by the plasmodium parasite that cannot thrive in the cold, high-altitude climate in Central Kenya, contributes greatly to the fatalities among children in Western and Nyanza.\nThe rainfall, temperature, and humidity in Nyanza shortens the life cycle of the plasmodium vector and increases its chances of survival for throughout the year.\nThen there is a complicated issue involving the prevalence of HIV, a woman's level of education and poverty.\nNyanza and the Coast have always recorded very high rates of teenage pregnancies, a factor that has kept many girls out of school.\nTeachers in the affected areas like Kilifi, Homa Bay and Malindi cited poverty as a cause for these pregnancies.\nBetween 2012 and 2013, 17 girls dropped out of Nyajanja Secondary School in Kochia, Homa Bay County, alarming Mr Samuel Odhiambo Okelo, the principal, who had worked there for barely two years.\nMost of these girls lack even the bare essentials like food and sanitary towels at home and when they can get them through men, the results are pregnancies,\" he said.\nAccording to the survey, 19.2 per cent of girls aged between 15 and 19 in Homa Bay County have already had a live birth, while 22.2 per cent within this age group are already married and, therefore, expected to have children.\nIn addition, contraception uptake among women aged 15 to 49 in the county is below average, standing at 46.7 per cent.\nWhile youngsters between the ages of 15 and 19 in this region are sexually active, their use of contraception, even as disease preventing measures such as condom use, is the lowest, standing at below 5 per cent.\nWith a high incidence of pregnancies among young girls, enrolment in school is very low in the affected areas.\nIt is, therefore, hardly surprising that the report indicated that only 30 per cent of young mothers (under the age of 18) sought medical attention before, during and after delivery.\nNyamira County defies Nyanza trend\nIt is notable that Nyamira County's health indicators stood in start contrast to the general trend in Nyanza.\nNyamira had the fewest cases of diarrhoea and ARIs, with only 3 per cent, the highest vaccination coverage (95 per cent), and a very low fever presence in children (5.7 per cent).\nThe county's chief medical officer, in the Department of Health services, Mr Douglas Bosire, said that the county had spent the largest portion of its health budget on preventive and promotive medicine (Sh 150million), than on curative medicine, planning and administrative issues.\nMr Bosire attributed the commendable medical seeking behaviour of the people in the county to the strong community health network.\n\"They have taught people about toilets, using water properly, handling food and other issues about sanitation,\" he explained.\n***\nFYI\nAccording to World Health Organisation guidelines, a child is considered to have received all the basic vaccinations after being inoculated against the following diseases: tuberculosis, which is also known as\nBCG; three doses each of the DPT-HepB-Hib, which prevents diphtheria; whooping cough (pertussis); tetanus, also referred to as pentavalent; polio; and measles.\nSevere diarrhoea, which causes dehydration, has been implicated in many WHO studies as a major cause of sickness and mortality among young children.\nThe counties with the highest cases of ARIs used firewood and charcoal as a primary source of energy for domestic use.

        "text": "Climate finance dominated the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations at its 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties, (COP 21) in Paris, France.\nAt the beginning of the conference, France pledged two billion euros for renewable energy in Africa. Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland promised an additional $248 million for adaptation, and the World Bank $500 million for reducing GHG emissions. Compared to what Africa requires, this is a drop in the ocean.\nAfrican countries returned home with baskets full of pledges, which from experience may take another two years before actual disbursements are made. In the meantime, climate change will have had its adverse effects on the continent.\nGlobal temperatures are poised to rise beyond 2Celsius of pre-industrial levels come 2030 under current greenhouse gas emissions. This would have serious consequences for Africa, given that many countries in the continent have low adaptive capacity and heavily rely on rain-fed agriculture. Food insecurity problems, due to weather changes, will be imminent.\nThis fact makes adaptation to climate changes a priority for the continent. Although Africa's emissions account for a paltry 7 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and its per capita emissions are less than half the global average, it is estimated that for the continent to effectively respond to climate change it requires between $2-3 billion every year. These are estimates equivalent to some of the countries' gross domestic product and will exert enormous pressure on national budgets.\nThe framework for climate financing dictates that developed countries make available resources to support adaptation measures in developing countries. During the Copenhagen Conference in 2009, developed countries promised to mobilise $100 billion a year by 2020, from both public and private sources, to help developing nations limit their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate extremes.\nReports commissioned by the developed countries claim that between 2010 and 2012, more than $33 billion has been disbursed for climate activities in Africa. It is difficult to confirm this claim given that there is no clear system of tracking climate funds. Moreover, most African countries have no climate fund through which such funds would be pooled.\nHowever, the flow of climate financing has not been without its fair share of challenges. It has been noted that climate flows are slow and it takes more than two years between commitment and actual disbursement.\nThe funds also tend to support mitigation projects particularly in the energy sector, ignoring adaptation activities. In addition, these funds have large transaction costs, at times as high as 20 per cent of project cost, which impedes optimal implementation of activities.\nAt the same time, many recipient countries have been ill-prepared to access and absorb pledged resources due to weak domestic policy and regulatory environment.\nCOP21 closed with an agreement that is legally binding, especially to those responsible for high emissions to cut them in order to maintain global temperatures below 2 degrees centigrade. Commitment to financial pledges by developed countries will have to wait as we decry African countries' readiness to absorb these funds.",

It costs about Sh10, 000 but they are distributed and sold at a subsidised price of Sh1500,\" Ms Petra Wadstrom, a Swedish national, told Daily Nation at Le Bourget on Thursday a few hours before the award ceremony.\n\"We know climate change is putting stress on available water sources leading to contamination thus increases the chances of cholera, typhoid and the likes. Therefore, this portable device is changing the lives of families in Kibera, Bungoma and several counties in Kenya,\" she added.\nAccording to the Swedish inventor, Ms Petra Wadstrom over 2,500 Solvatten devices have been distributed and have benefitted 12,900 people in Nairobi's urban slums.\nMs Wadstrom says this thus reduces the need to boil water by burning firewood or charcoal while increasing renewable energy, reducing deforestation. She says using a Solvatten unit saves 5-6 mid-size trees.\nThe other awardee is the Azuri PayGo Energy that has combined solar and mobile phone technology in turn providing lighting and mobile charging services not only to Kenyans but also to people in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Malawi among others.\nThe user, after installation, can purchase a scratch card, or uses an integrated mobile money service to top-up their unit.\nGrundfos Lifelink Water Solutions is also lined up for an award that provides access to safe, sustainable and affordable water to people in developing countries.\nTo collect water, people charge a smart card with credit bought onsite or via their mobile phones, insert it into the dispenser and pay for the water they need.",

        "text": "As delegates sharpen their gear for this year's Conference of the Parties (COP-21) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), African environmental experts are hoping that the continent will this time round get a fair deal out of the negotiations.\nThe summit is scheduled to adopt a binding agreement to curb the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing runaway global warming and climate change, and which is expected to take full effect in 2020. Negotiators will also discuss mitigation, adaptation, losses and damages, climate finance, technology transfer, and a variety of other issues.\nThe Paris summit comes after more than 20 years of climate negotiations, and 18 years after the Kyoto Protocol was agreed. Having failed to act decisively in Copenhagen in 2009, this is probably the last chance for the international community to avert temperature rises beyond 2Celsius.\nIf temperature rises exceed 2C, say scientists, this will lead to major and dangerous climate consequences, especially in the developing world.\nGREATEST THREAT\nGlobal climate change ranks among the greatest threats that humanity has faced and is on par with the threat of nuclear annihilation and mass pandemic diseases, and perhaps no other region on Earth has as much at stake as does the African continent.\n\"Climate change is a defining challenge for development in Africa,\" says Guido Schmidt-Traub, a former climate change advisor to the Swiss-based Africa Progress Panel Secretariat and current\nExecutive Director of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), which has been instrumental in bolstering the new UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nAfrica contributes the least to global emissions. And yet, if carbon emissions continue to increase (which looks likely) and global temperatures continue to rise (also likely), the continent would undoubtedly face further environmental degradation such as deforestation, desertification, declining soil productivity, loss of biodiversity and depletion of fresh water.\nThese environmental challenges have implications for food crop production, food security, water supplies, health, livelihoods of the poor and the sustainability of economic growth.\nThe Indian and Atlantic oceans surrounding the continent are also being affected by rising global temperatures - as evident by the Pacific Ocean El Nino weather currently affecting East Africa.\nCoral reefs off the East African coast will be particularly vulnerable. These are a treasure trove of biodiversity and also support some hundreds of millions of people, the majority in developing regions,\nwith various ecosystem services, the conditions and processes through which natural ecosystems, and the species that compose them, sustain and fulfill human life, including food, materials, transport, and shelter.\nFURTHER DECLINE\n\"Coral reefs will certainly decline further and be unable to recover from multiple other impacts, and mangroves and seagrasses will also be strongly affected,\" says Dr David Obura, coordinator for the\nMombasa-based Coastal Oceans Research and Development - Indian Ocean (Cordio) East Africa, which supports research and monitoring of coral reefs and coastal ecosystems in mainland Africa and\nIndian Ocean island states.\nThe economic effects of global warming are already being felt in East Africa. Recently, all hydropower plants in Tanzania were switched off because drought has led to low water levels in the country's dams.\nIn Zanzibar, seaweed (mwani in Kiswahili) has been one of Zanzibar's key exports for over two decades (it's used as a base for cosmetics, lotions, toothpaste, medicines and food).\nAt its peak, the trade contributed almost $8 million (817 million) a year to the Zanzibar economy.\nIn the process, it had lifted many women out of poverty. But many women in recent times have abandoned seaweed farming blaming rising sea temperatures for a mass dying of seaweed.\nOften called the first 'climate war', Darfur's ongoing conflicts in the Sudan is the starkest example of how climate change can contribute to violent conflict in Africa.\nAccording to the UNEP's environment and conflict analysis, regional climate variability, water scarcity and the steady loss of fertile land have contributed to the various wars in Darfur.\nSUCCUMB TO TEMPERATURES\nAccording to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's Global Humanitarian Forum (2009), already more than 300,000 current deaths per year are attributable to climate change. And more Africans will succumb to the effects of increasing global temperatures.\nAccording to a 2006 Christian Aid report, an estimated 182 million Africans will die due to climate related disease this century.\nIn the past, Africa has gotten a raw deal (by having no deal) at previous COPs conferences in getting developed nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Big industry and global politics have triumphed over science and the future of humanity in previous COP meetings.\nNegotiators from North America, Europe, Saudi Arabia, all the BRICS countries, Japan and Australia have been accused of betrayal by knowingly sabotaging progress on climate change.\n\"The critical moments that defined Africa's future climate crisis, however, were in December 2009 in Copenhagen,\" says Professor Patrick Bond of the University of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, and Director of the Centre for Civil Society.\n\"The negotiations at COP15 were diverted one night into a room where five leaders - from the US, Brazil, China, India and South Africa - agreed on a side deal, the Copenhagen Accord.\nThat was the source of Africa's major problems in climate negotiations for years thereafter, including at Paris.\"\nIt's ironic that Africa, the region most affected by global warming, appears to have the weakest negotiating power at the COP conferences, including the Paris summit.\nEqually poignant is that the annual UNFCCC COP has been held on the continent on three separate occasions: in 2001 in Marrakech, 2006 in Nairobi and 2011 in Durban.\nMany experts are calling for Africa to take the lead in presenting the science and getting a fair deal at the COP-21 in Paris, but the continent has its own inherent weaknesses that prevent it from being the force it should be when it comes to influencing global climate change policy.\nSome observers believe that its negotiators might not necessarily have the ability to contribute tangibly to finalisation of documents and resolutions.\n\"Africa lacks a critical mass of expertise to lobby or make meaningful conclusion,\" says Prof Ruth K Oniang'o, a Kenyan food and nutrition scientist and Editor-in-Chief of the African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development (AJFAND).\n\"Those from outside Africa working on these crucial issues then end up talking for and about Africa at these global gatherings.\nFlooding, drought, increased temperatures and associated incidents hurt Africa and threaten its very survival. As Africans, we need to own these issues, but we also need to train negotiators to represent the continent.\"\nBLOCKING THE COP-21\nNevertheless, African civil society groups are already preparing their strategy for forcing the COP-21 to finally give the continent and other environmentally vulnerable developing regions a fair deal in spite of the strength of Western governments and multinational corporations.\nActivists are planning on civil society blocking the COP21 delegates into (not out of) the negotiating chamber on December 11 to 12, that is if they have not succeeded in coming to a planet-saving deal (a tactic known as Redlines).\nThe tactic of blocking negotiators in could have the effect of legitimising their work and in the sense would potentially generate the goodwill needed for a deal.\nThe Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), a continental coalition of civil society organisations on the African continent brought together by a common agenda of promoting and advocating for\nclimate related and equity based development that considers climate change as a key driver of sustainable development, will play a critical role in getting the African agenda on the negotiation tables in\nParis.\nAt the preparatory session in Dar es Salaam last September, the PACJA told the African negotiators to be stronger and tougher than at previous COPs since it's a now-or-never situation of finally getting\na 2 degree Celsius limit and related funding and technology transfer pledges.\nThe Paris deal must also address the issue of reparations for the \"loss and damage\" (the UN's technical term) that Western greenhouse gas emitters have done to \"climate creditor\" developing\neconomies such as those in Africa (\"loss and damage\" would be when a country loses half its GDP and is no longer able to adapt to global warming in an incremental fashion). But the voluntary nature of Copenhagen and its Green Climate Fund means there is no legal liability on the part of \"climate debtors\" in the Global North.\n\"The specific climatic conditions in Africa, especially the need for a rigorous accounting of climate debt owed by the Global North for net loss and damage here, are ignored to the extent that Africa's negotiating power is terribly weak,\" says Prof Bond of the University of KwaZulu Natal\nSubsistence farmers in Africa are seen as the key to reducing hunger and malnutrition on the continent and it is they who will be most affected Climate finance mechanisms need to be improved or designed in a way that benefits smallholder farmers in Africa (it's estimated that Africa needs $10-20 billion per year in additional external support to adapt to climate change).\n\"African smallholders cannot escape poverty unless they are equipped to adapt to a changing climate,\" says Dr Katrin Glatzel, a Policy and Research Officer at Agriculture for Impact, London, UK. \"This requires serious, large-scale investment from donors, developed country governments and the private sector\"\nKenya's subsistence farmers are themselves asking for community grain drying facilities which are not open-air so as to prevent unexpected and erratic rains from destroying grain which may be drying, and pulses such as beans and peas needed for good nutrition.\nOrganisations such as AJFAND are supporting the use of canvas to keep the grain uncontaminated.\nThese canvases are easier to fold and protect the grain should the rains suddenly appear. AJFAND is also supporting the use of hermetic bags to protect against insects once the grain is well dried, as well as integrated soil fertility management, a programme supported by Alliance for a Green Revolution for Africa (with climate variability and El Nino, new pests and diseases also emerge).\n\"We are clearly concerned about food shortage, hunger and malnutrition being exacerbated. Major food crop and livestock losses will likely be experienced by farmers and push them to severe economic shock,\" says Prof Oniang'o. \"I doubt that African governments are adequately prepared for this, not even Kenya.\nFood prices for urban dwellers will certainly go up. Farmers can be innovative but governments are the ones to really step up and help to look for solutions from wherever they exist and help their smallholder farmers.\"\nAdaptation is already taking place in some of Africa's most ecologically fragile regions, such as Kenya's drylands. In Laikipia District, an estimated two-thirds of the land is privately-held commercial ranches. In recent years, Maa-speaking pastoralists, including the Maasai and Samburu, opened discussions with ranch owners and managers about allowing them to access pasture inside ranches. This was a result of the severe 2009-2010 drought.\nPOSITIVE EFFECTS\nResponding to climatic conditions such as drought is having positive effects on other areas of the herding lifestyle such as conflict resolution.\nDuring the severe drought of 2009-2010, individual Maa-speaking herd-owners in Laikipia negotiated with Meru and Kikuyu small-holder farmers living adjacent to Mt Kenya to graze their livestock on farms.\nThe agreement, which was built on traditions of cooperation between these neighbouring communities, permitted herders to move their livestock during the day into the Mt Kenya forest (where they were prevented from residing) and to be kraaled at night on farms near the forest perimeter.\nIt was a win-win scenario for both groups. The herders were able to access critically needed fodder in the Mt Kenya forest during the drought while farmers were able to keep the manure of livestock kept on farms.\nClimate change has made movement necessary even during wet periods. In the Pokot areas of western Kenya, when the herds trek to find the best grazing during the rainy season, some livestock (about five to ten animals) remain in the permanent homesteads feeding on hay.\nThis is meant to provide milk, meat and blood for the family in the manyattas or homesteads (Pokot women traditionally took hay for calves and the weaker animals).\nSuch a simple act has allowed Pokot children to stay at home and attend school. Hay is cut and stored for feeding in the dry season.\nIn the field of water management, adaptation is also taking place. The Pokot are able to store a small amount of precious water for the dry season by constructing small dams across streams and small rivers using stones and sometimes cement supplied by local NGOs.\nThe Pokot can also source water stored in the sand even during the severest drought.\nPERENNIAL DILEMMA\nThe perennial dilemma for Africa has always been that it does not produce high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. And the poorest countries in Africa and elsewhere must be allowed economic development, as industrialisation did for the West, without any constraints over the near term.\nBut African governments fear that radical action on emissions will significantly reduce economic growth and increase unemployment in a time when poverty reduction remains national priorities throughout the developing world.\nHowever, this need not be the case. Recent reports from the Deep Decarbonisation Pathway Project, for example, have demonstrated that the transformation towards low-carbon development is\npossible and can be consistent with the long-term development aspirations of emerging economies and established nation-states, if decisive action is taken.\nIt's a big ask though, because it requires a long-term transformation of every country's energy system. But the Paris agreement must also include a provision that every country develop non-binding\nNational Deep Decarbonisation Pathways through to 2050.\nThe harsh reality is that the world is most likely to warm by between 3-5C, because politicians at the Paris climate summit won't be willing or able to make the scale of cuts needed to keep temperature rises under 2C.\n\"If negotiating tactics change and African negotiators plus civil society allies do what they did in Seattle in 1999 or Doha in 2001, where the target was the WTO, then maybe the Global North and\nBRICS will have reason to take Africa and its scientists seriously,\" says Prof Bond.",

        "text": "Angry developing nations warned Thursday that increasingly tense UN talks aimed at averting catastrophic climate change would fail unless a bitter feud over hundreds of billions of dollars was resolved.\nNegotiators from 195 nations are haggling in Paris over a planned universal accord to slash greenhouse-gas emissions that trap the Sun's heat, warming Earth's surface and oceans and disrupting its delicate climate system.\nTaking effect from 2020, the pact would target emissions from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas - the backbone of the world's energy supply today - as well as from the cutting down of rainforests.\nThe question of finance to help developing countries make the shift to cleaner energy sources is \"make or break\", said South African negotiator Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko, who spoke on behalf of the G77 group of 134 developing and emerging countries, plus China.\n\"It has to be clearly understood that finance is critical,\" she told a news conference.\nAt stake is hundreds of billions of dollars that would need to start flowing from rich to developing nations from 2020. However the developed nations have yet to fully commit to the financing deal.\nWith frustrations at the conference mounting, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the world's leading economies to honour the financing pledge they made at the last major climate summit six years ago.\n\"I have been urging the developed world leaders that this must be delivered,\" Ban told reporters at UN headquarters in New York. \"This is one very important promise.\"\nOf the $100 billion to be mobilised by 2020, $62 billion has been raised so far, he added.\nMore than 150 world leaders including President Barack Obama launched the talks Monday, seeking to build momentum for the tough negotiations ahead with lofty rhetoric about the urgency of the task.\nBut after three days of grinding discussions over a hugely complex 54-page draft pact, bureaucrats unveiled a document just four pages shorter and with vast stretches of text yet to be agreed.\nFRAYED TEMPERS\nBy the end of a day of frustratingly slow negotiations, tempers frayed.\n\"I am deeply concerned. I'm out of words. I have been doing this for many years, and this is just not right,\" Bolivia's Juan Hoffmaister, representing the G77 and China, told fellow negotiators at an evening session.\nAt the heart of the dispute is a demand by developing nations that the rich shoulder the most responsibility for fighting global warming because they have emitted most of the greenhouse gases since the start of the Industrial Revolution.\nBut some rich nations point out that developing nations, particularly China and India, are now big polluters.\nNorwegian negotiator Aslak Brun said they were grappling with \"very hard lines on all sides\".\n\"Pointing fingers at this point in time saying: 'you are to blame and we are the good guys', it doesn't help us. Collectively, we just have to really speed up,\" he said.\nMinisters from around the globe will descend on Paris Monday to try to transform the draft prepared by diplomats into a universal accord to avert planetary overheating. The conference is scheduled to end on December 11.\n'UNTHINKABLE FAILURE'\nFrench Environment Minister Segolene Royal said she was still confident warring sides would come together by December 11.\n\"It is normal for it to take a day or two for negotiations to get into gear,\" she told AFP.\n\"It is unthinkable to imagine failure.\"\nAt the core of the talks is the goal of limiting average warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels.\nScientists warn time for action is running out, issuing ever-louder warnings that steadily growing carbon emissions will doom future generations to rising seas and worsening floods, storms and drought - a recipe for hunger, disease and homelessness for many millions.\nJames Hansen, one of the world's foremost climate scientists, warned in an interview with AFP that even capping warming to 2 C was a massive risk.\n\"Two degrees Celsius warming above pre-Industrial would put us at least at the temperature of the last inter-glacial period. Sea level was six to nine metres (20-30 feet) higher then,\" he said.",

        "text": "World leaders Monday vowed to save mankind from catastrophic climate change as an historic summit opened with the \"hope of all of humanity\" laid on their shoulders, but fault lines quickly emerged.\nThe heads of more than 150 nations - a record - kicked off 12 days of talks in search of an elusive pact that would shift the world economy away from its heavy use of fossil fuels blamed for global warming.\nThey gathered at a conference centre in Le Bourget on the northern outskirts of Paris, swathed by heavy security following terror attacks in the city which appear to have spurred the push for a climate breakthrough.\n\"Never have the stakes of an international meeting been so high, because it concerns the future of the planet, the future of life,\" French President Francois Hollande said in an opening speech.\n\"The hope of all of humanity rests on all of your shoulders.\"\nScientists warn that without urgent action to curb greenhouse gases, mankind will suffer worsening droughts, floods, storms and rising seas, threatening millions with hunger, disease and migration.\nLow-lying island nations would face oblivion.\nMonday's event was the largest single-day gathering of heads of state or government in history, the United Nations said, highlighting widespread global commitment to the climate fight.\nMany leaders also vowed to forge an ambitious deal in honour of the 130 people killed in the November 13 attacks in Paris, claimed by the Islamic State group.\nThe leaders began their talks with a minute of silence to remember the dead.\nBOLD PROMISES\nUS President Barack Obama, who flew to Paris on the eve of the conference to pay homage to the victims, made a speech pledging American commitment and urging others to do the same.\n\"The United States of America not only recognises our role in creating this problem but embraces its responsibility to do something about it,\" Obama said, as he warned \"the hour\" of being too late was near.\n\"The future is one that we have the power to change, right here, right now.\"\nObama had earlier met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, bringing together the leaders of the two biggest carbon emitters, to highlight a partnership on climate they began to forge in 2014.\nIn his speech, Xi reasserted China's pledge for its carbon emissions to peak by 2030.\nBut he also insisted rich nations shoulder comparatively more of the responsibility in curbing global warming.\n\"Addressing climate change should not deny the legitimate needs of developing countries to reduce poverty and improve their people's living standards,\" Xi said.\nHe demanded rich nations honour their commitment, dating back to 2009, to mobilise $100 billion (95 billion euros) a year by 2020 to tackle climate change in poorer countries.\nThe United Nations has hosted annual conferences to address global warming since 1995, but its efforts have stumbled on divisions between rich and poor.\nMany poor nations insist rich countries bear the most responsibility for tackling the problem as they have burnt the most fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution on their way to prosperity.\nBut the United States and other developed nations argue more must be done by China, India and other emerging giants, which are voraciously burning coal to power their fast-growing economies.\nCLIMATE 'JUSTICE'\nUnderscoring the difficulties ahead in Paris, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi argued his nation needed to continue burning cheap and plentiful coal to rise out of poverty, while developed countries should make deeper and faster cuts in their own emissions.\n\"The prosperous still have a strong carbon footprint and the world's billions at the bottom of the development ladder are seeking space to grow,\" he said.\nZimbabwean President Robert Mugabe lashed out at \"miserly\" developed nations that wanted to \"burden us with cleaning up the mess they themselves have created\".\nAnd Bolivia's left-wing president, Evo Morales, blasted capitalist greed for setting the planet on a path to doom.\n\"If we continue on the path trod by capitalism we are condemned to disappear,\" he warned.\nStumbling blocks in Paris include providing finance for climate-vulnerable and poor countries, and transferring renewable technologies to developing nations.\nScrutiny of commitments to curb greenhouse gases and the legal status of the accord are other expected negotiating battlegrounds.\nAboard the papal plane after a tour of Africa, Pope Francis warned however that it was \"now or never\" for the world community to hammer out a deal, warning the situation was \"borderline suicide\".\nImportant progress has nevertheless been made in the run-up to Paris, including a roster of voluntary pledges by 183 nations to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and other pro-climate measures.\nUN climate chief Christiana Figueres said these provide the architecture for more ambitious efforts that could eventually reach the goal of limiting warming to less than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-Industrial Revolution levels.\nNO PLANET B\nTo press world leaders into forging an agreement, more than half a million people participated in climate protests around the world over the weekend.\nFrench authorities had banned protests in Paris due to security fears following the terror attacks.\nBut thousands of people in Paris gathered to create a two-kilometre (1.2-mile) human chain.\nTheir stand was disrupted, however, when anti-capitalist militants infiltrated the protests, leading to clashes with riot police which saw hundreds of arrests.",

        "text": "A Kenyan delegation of at least 41 officials will Monday be heading to France for climate change talks, raising questions about the government's commitment to cutting public spending.\nA tentative list seen by the Daily Nation shows that officials in the Office of the President will form the bulk of the delegates travelling to Paris for the Climate Change Conference (COP21), which seeks to find better ways of managing the devastating effects of global warming.\nSome 18 delegates from the Office of the President will be travelling with President Uhuru Kenyatta to Paris, where they will join an advance team of nine officials.\nThis brings the total number of delegates from the Office of the President to 27.\nA former Foreign Affairs official said that the President and two Cabinet secretaries - Ms Amina Mohamed of Foreign and Prof Judi Wakhungu (Environment) will be attending the segment for heads of State.\nUsually, he said, they are accompanied by about 30 support staff.\nAccording to the list, the Ministry of Environment, under which climate change falls, had only one delegate on the list, a Ms Fatuma Hussein, of the Climate Change Secretariat.\nAlthough Prof Wakhungu, under whom the ministry falls, was not on the list seen by Nation, a source in her ministry said she had already travelled to Paris.\nThe source said the CS was accompanied by three other members from the Climate Change Secretariat - Dr Charles Mutai, Mr Omedi Jura and Mr Stephen Kimuyu.\nThere is a possibility, therefore, that there are more people travelling to Paris than was indicated in the tentative list.\nHowever, some of those on the list on Sunday confirmed to the Nation that they were indeed travelling.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is sending eight officials to the summit, including Ms Mohamed.\nA HUGE TEAM\nNational Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich - who was listed as a delegate - Sunday confirmed that he would not be travelling to Paris.\nAmong the officials on the list are National Environment Management Authority boss Geoffrey Wahungu, Kenya Forest Service director Emilio Mugo, Meteorological Services Director James Kongoti and Ms Lulu Hayanga of the State Law Office.\nThis brings the total number of delegates travelling to Paris to 41.\nAccording to the delegates list, the officials will be travelling today and will be in Paris until December 11.\nParliament will also be sending two members to the talks - Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo and Nairobi County Woman representative Rachel Shebesh.\nThe large number of delegates raises questions about the government's commitment to curbing runaway spending, which has left the country in an unprecedented financial crunch.\nIt is reminiscent of the big delegation of 29 MPs that travelled to the Netherlands for the just-concluded Assembly of State Parties meeting to push Kenya's position in the case against Deputy President William Ruto and former radio presenter Joshua arap Sang.\nThe cheapest return ticket to Paris is about Sh130,000.\nThis means that the delegation of 41 will use more than Sh5.3 million on air fare alone, assuming they all travel economy class.\nHotel bookings will cost another Sh19 million, assuming that the cost of a decent hotel in Paris is about Sh40,000 a night. These costs exclude any per diem paid to the officials.\nHYPOCRITICAL GOVERNMENT\nCalls to government officials to explain why Kenya needs to send such a large delegation to Paris went unanswered, with most officials contacted referring the Nation to the Foreign Ministry.\nLast month, Mr Rotich announced a raft of austerity measures to reduce public spending, just weeks after announcing that the country was experiencing a cash crisis.\nFeatured prominently in the document were proposed spending cuts on foreign trips by government officials.\nAccording to the brief prepared by the National Treasury, the number of aides who accompany Cabinet and principal secretaries on foreign trips was to have been reduced significantly.\nThe brief said three Cabinet secretaries have been known to take between six and seven aides on foreign trips.",

        "text": "The government's failure to transform the agriculture sector into a viable business is to blame for food insecurity in Kenya, say experts.\nAgriculture experts say Kenya's potential in food production has remained unutilised despite promises by the government to reform the sector.\nThe country is endowed with a favourable climate but has been unable to produce enough to feed its population.\nDuring the National Agricultural Sector Conference in 2008, the government pledged to transform agriculture into a viable business.\nAt the conference, key players in the sector had been invited to decide the way forward in redeeming the country from food deficiency.\nThe commitment is contained in the country's development blueprint Vision 2030.\nDEVELOPMENT BLUE PRINT\nAs stipulated in the blueprint, agriculture, being the main sector in the country's economy, tops the agenda of the reforms.\nThere is also the Maputo Declaration of 2003, when African leaders pledged to increase budgetary allocations to the sector to 10 per cent of their budgets.\nKenya has complied with the declaration.\nVision 2030 also states that idle land would be utilised for crop and livestock production. And this was to be done five years after the blueprint was launched in 2008.\nIt further says that 600,000 to 1.2 million hectares was to be put under irrigation within the same period.\nThe Jubilee administration had promised in its manifesto that it would put one million acres in Galana/Kulalu area in Kilifi and Tana River counties under irrigation by 2017.\nThis was one of the government's flagship project to boost food security. The Agriculture Ministry projected that at least 80 million bags of maize would be harvested on completion of the project.\nThe project is still incomplete.\nOut of the 58 million hectares that forms the country's landmass, slightly over five million hectares have been cultivated.\nAccording to FAO, Kenya's natural abundance is illustrated by 164 sub-basins with perennial river flows and 33 sub-basins endowed with seasonal river systems.\nThe country also sits on enormous amounts of ground water in Turkana County, which hosts the Lotikipi Basin Aquifer System.\nThe aquifer is estimated to have some 250 billion cubic metres of water.\nTo appreciate just how much Lotikipi has, one only needs to know that the whole country consumes about three billion cubic metres of water each year.\nFurther, Kenya's five major drainage systems and other sources of renewable water resources contain an estimated 30.7 billion cubic metres.\nAlthough, the amount of rain Kenya receives is not uniform throughout the country, experts say the country receives 365.6 cubic kilometres of water - with each cubic kilometre estimated to be enough water to supply to 70,000 people for a lifetime.\nClimate change-induced droughts have also had a major impact on food production and dietary intake in Kenya.\nMeteorological data shows that the country has been experiencing minor droughts every two to three years and major droughts after eight to 10 years.\nSEVERE DROUGHT\nTypically, the severe droughts have decimated 30 per cent to 40 per cent of wildlife and livestock, and 30 per cent to 40 per cent of crop yields, besides wrecking the natural ability of grasslands to regenerate.\nThis decline in land productivity has created food shortages, with up to 16 per cent (about five million) of Kenyans surviving on food relief every year.\n\"Not only are these people unable to get one meal a day but what is available is of very poor quality, leading to severe malnutrition,\" observes Mr Elijah Agevi, the chief executive of Research Triangle, a Nairobi-based think tank on policy, housing and urban development.\nMr Agevi says malnutrition affects 25-30 per cent of the population.\nBut why has it been that a country so blessed with what it takes to produce enough for consumption and for export cannot even feed itself?\nSome experts blame land fragmentation for creating small sizes of plots where poverty is recycled.\nThis scenario can be traced back to the 1960s when Kenya was in a rush to end the colonial legacy of landlessness, leading to splitting up of large-scale farms into smaller units.\nThe end result has been that much of the agriculture-rich areas across the country now have what Mr Agevi terms \"economically unviable\" land sizes.\n\"Today, some 89 per cent of the households in Kenya are living on less than three hectares, while 47 per cent lives on farms of less than 0.6 hectares and only 10 per cent of the holdings, or 575,000 households, are above three hectares,\" he says.\nOne cause of food insecurity that has received little attention yet it determines how much of Kenya has remained productive is the fact that the land use system adopted since independence borders on anarchy.\nIn many parts of the country, any individual can do whatever they wish with land, chiefly because they hold titles to it.\n\"Land use system is in a state of confusion,\" says Dr Isaac Mwangi, a senior lecturer at the University of Nairobi's Department of Urban and Regional Planning.\nDr Mwangi attributes this to lack of an \"overarching\" policy.\n\"Unless decisive actions to come up with a national land use policy are made, Kenyans can surely expect to be etching closer to crunch time,\" he argues.\nThe country, he says, is itching to attain a 50 per cent level of urbanisation without a discernible national land use plan or how to manage the many and diversified needs of millions of people living in such a concentrated manner.\nMr Agevi argues Kenya is yet to develop an agricultural land use master plan with a zoning system that would set aside and preserve exclusive areas for food production.\nTo Mr Agevi, a national land use policy embeds a \"philosophy of how land and natural resources ought to be exploited.\"\nARABLE LAND\nTo get a better glimpse of how much Kenyans have recklessly destroyed the ability of arable land to meet food needs for millions, Dr Mwangi cites the vast areas between Limuru Road from the Northern Bypass junction in Nairobi to Limuru Town, and from Turi to Muchorwi in Molo, Nakuru County.\nHe also cites areas between Kisumu and Kakamega towns and from Kisii to Rongo.",

        "text": "The full potential of the financial system will need to be harnessed to deliver the new Sustainable Development Goals and the forthcoming climate change agreement in Paris.\nThe scale of financing required for an orderly transition to a prosperous, low-carbon and resilient economy is measured in the trillions, not the billions. This means more capital for assets that protect and enhance natural capital and less for assets that deplete critical life support systems, such as biodiversity, soils, water and the global climate.\nIt is not just the quantum of finance that needs to change - but also its quality so that core financial services are attuned to the ways in which sustainability recasts the traditional risk : reward ratio.\nREAD: What scientists are doing to eliminate deadly wheat rust\nREAD: Turkana hardest hit by climate change - report\nREAD: Kenya to conduct annual tree planting campaign\nAcross the world, the awareness and commitment of financial institutions in banking, investment and insurance is growing. But what is striking is how financial policymakers, central banks and regulators are now taking steps to incorporate sustainability factors into the rules that govern the financial system as a whole.\nJust last month, for example, the Financial Stability Board held its first meeting with representatives from the financial community to explore the implications of climate change for the more than US$300 trillion in assets within the financial system.\nThis move is part of a much broader trend in financial policy that is captured in a new report from UNEP's Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable Financial System. Established in early 2014, the Inquiry has sought to understand why and how financial rule-makers are incorporating environmental and social factors into their core tasks of shaping efficient, resilient and effective financial markets.\nWhat the Inquiry has found is a 'quiet revolution', with actions across banking, insurance, pensions and securities markets.\nMuch of the leadership is coming from developing and emerging economies. In Brazil, for example, the central bank has introduced requirements for all banks to incorporate socio-environmental factors into their core systems for governing risks.\nIndonesia's financial services authority, OJK, has released a 10-year roadmap for sustainable finance. The People's Bank of China has also released a comprehensive strategy for greening its financial system, with priorities including growing the burgeoning green bond market, strengthening environmental disclosure and clarifying lender liability.\nUNTAPPED POTENTIAL\nAction is also underway in developed markets. In France, new measures have been introduced that will bring greater transparency to the climate performance of investment funds, while in the USA, state-level insurance regulators, such as California are incorporating climate factors into their supervision programmes.\nIn the UK, the Prudential Regulatory Authority has just published its own assessment of the risks that climate change poses for the insurance sector.\nBut this shift does not just involve formal regulatory authorities. Other market rule-makers such as stock exchanges, credit rating agencies and accounting bodies are increasingly taking sustainability into account.\nMany of these measures are relatively new and what the Inquiry has done is structure this emerging experience into a framework for action that offers a basket of options for policymakers to deploy across the financial system.\nEfforts at the national level will be crucial to better manage risks in the financial system as well as drive the financial innovation that is needed to mobilise the capital required.\nInternational financial cooperation is also vital to share best practice and coordinate efforts across the world's markets. The Sustainable Banking Network is a growing group of banking regulators from developing countries who are seeking to incorporate social and environmental factors into their routine practices.\nThese initiatives are just the beginning of a more systematic approach to building a sustainable financial system.\nThe next steps will require the involvement of many actors, including the stewards of the financial system (including financial ministries, central banks and regulators), as well as financial institutions, international organizations, the sustainable development community, as well as individuals in their capacity as consumers of financial services, as employees of financial institutions and as participants in civil society.\nThe direction is clear - and the potential within the financial system is still largely untapped. Realizing this potential is essentially a matter of public choice - a choice that a growing number of countries are already taking.",

        "text": "I moved to the northern part of Kenya last year and for the duration that I have been here I have lost count of the number conflicts that I have heard or witnessed.\nEarly this year, I was caught in the middle of a deadly clash at Leparua, along the border of Isiolo and Laikipia Counties that left three people dead and one person nursing serious injuries.\nThe area is home to the traditionally pastoralist Samburu, Ndorobo, Turkana, Somali and Borana communities.\nThe fight broke out after some morans from Samburu community had raided and stolen sixty heads of cattle from their Ndorobo neighbor.\nWhat caught my attention, however, was the Isiolo Deputy County Commissioner's statement that conflict between the communities has 'escalated in the recent times'. The statement was echoed by my colleagues, acquaintances and friends. One study I looked at later on stated that, 'violent conflicts involving pastoralists have become widespread and increasingly severe in the North Rift and North Eastern regions of Kenya.'\nApart from Leparua, several conflicts have been reported in the North Rift, North Eastern, North Western as well as other parts of Kenya. Another clash that left several people dead, houses burnt and scores injured was reported along the border of Kisumu and Nandi Counties around the same time for the same reasons.\nWhat could be the reason behind escalation of these conflicts?\nLivestock is a symbol of wealth and source of livelihood among the pastoralists. Land ownership among the pastoralists is still largely communal. Sharing pastures and water is therefore inevitable and competition is unavoidable when the resources become scarce. Recently, the natural resources required to sustain pastoralism have been diminishing. Water sources are drying up and grazing pastures are shrinking due to frequent and severe drought and famine.\nRainfall and drought data and household surveys from northern Kenya confirm that the 'frequency and severity of droughts have increased in recent decades, with episodes of moderate to severe drought occurring more frequently since the 1980s'. Data collected from Lodwar, indicated decrease in rainfall by 13 millimeters between 1950-1973 and 1974-2008. Long rains in central Kenya have declined by more than 100 millimeters since the mid-1970s. This is clear evidence of climate change.\nWhen the areas occupied by pastoralists experience prolonged drought due to change in climate as has been the case in the recent past, the communities lose unimaginably large numbers of their livestock. This often results in raiding and cattle rustling to replenish the lost stock and brutal fights over the diminishing natural resources.\nBetween September and December 2008, scores of people died during clashes over water in Mandera. In 2008/2009, when Kenya was hit by one of the most devastating droughts in history, the northern part was the most affected. Isiolo, Marsabit and Samburu experienced severe food shortages, massive population displacement and loss of lives.\nIn January 2009, about 40 people lost their lives while fighting over water and pasture in the three areas alone. Children were forced out of school and livestock affected by climate related diseases. Violent fights, water scarcity and poor water quality forced massive migration in Ijara and Wajir. Over 10 million people across the country were hit by food insecurity.\nOn May 2nd, 2011, in what later became known as the infamous Todonyang massacre, 28 Turkana traders, mainly children and women, were attacked, brutally killed and bodies mutilated by Dassanech's Merille militia. A total of 46 people died later in a retaliatory attack by Turkana warriors. The conflict was instigated by climate induced natural resource scarcity (fish, water and grazing pastures).\nSadly, it is projected that average temperatures in Kenya are likely to increase in the range of 1-3 Celsius by the 2050s yet a warming of more than 1 Celsius may exacerbate drying impacts, especially in lowland areas. If this happens, the conflicts may escalate further.\nTo tame the conflicts, deaths, injuries, migrations and food insecurity all we need to do is to mitigate climate change by keeping global warming below 1.5Celcius. Climate change is injustice and injustice anywhere is everywhere. Our actions anywhere affect the whole system.\nWe can therefore take action wherever we are to curb climate change. Simple acts like tree planting, switching off lights when not in use, avoiding products that harm the environment, wise waste disposal to curb greenhouse gas emissions from landfills, adopting renewable and clean energy e.g. biogas, solar and wind power, water and energy conservation, cutting down on air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, discouraging deforestation, use of charcoal, coal and fossil fuels, protection of water catchment areas, stocking the right number of livestock, adopting sustainable land use practices, creating awareness and educating others about climate change, its impacts and what we can do to save our planet will go a long way!",

        "text": "One in every five people in Africa is undernourished due to insufficient nutritious food, a World Bank report shows.\nThis translates to 230 million Africans. This number could rise to 350 million by 2050 if appropriate adaptation measures are not taken to cope with the intensity of future climate change.\nAccording to the report released at the ongoing Africa Green Revolution Forum (AGRF) conference at UN, Gigiri, a projected rise in extreme weather conditions and average temperatures of about two degree Celsius by mid-century could substantially reduce the land suitable for growing the main staple crops, and reduce crop yields by up to 20 per cent.\nAfrican agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate risks but is also a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nThe report notes that climate change and food insecurity are the twin crises that may define Africa's future.\nFood production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) needs to increase by 60 per cent over the next 15 years to feed a growing population.\nFeeding Africa nutritiously and sustainably will require a more sustainable and climate-smart food system. Without major investments in agriculture, the average African would have access to 21 per cent fewer calories and climate change would increase the number of malnourished children by 10 million.\nThe report notes that if unaddressed, climate change will erode Africa's hard-won development achievements and jeopardise the prospects for further growth and poverty reduction.\nFortunately, African agriculture is well-positioned for transformational change. Throughout Africa, there are over 200 million hectares of uncultivated land that can be brought to productive use.\nAfrica uses only two per cent of its renewable water sources. Africa's food and beverage markets are expected to top $1 trillion (Sh101 trillion) in value by 2030. More than a dozen agribusiness investment funds have set their sights on Africa.\nAfrican agriculture is also energised by entrepreneurial youth and an engaged private sector that is taking note of its potential. Young Africans are making agriculture a viable business, creating opportunities for farmers, as well as themselves.\nThe report found that while agriculture contributes to the climate problem, producing significant greenhouse gas emissions, it also has the potential to be part of the solution here in Africa. Improved practices can help African countries increase productivity, while also enhancing the resilience of farming systems, and achieving lower emissions-the triple win of climate-smart agriculture.\nThe Africa Climate Business Plan was launched in Paris to address Africa's intricately linked climate and development agendas.",

The Paris Climate Agreement, adopted by 195 parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) last December in Paris, calls on countries to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future.\nSome 175 countries signed the Paris Agreement at a ceremony in New York on April 22, far exceeding the historical record for first-day signatures to an international agreement.\nSigning must be followed by the deposit of the instrument of ratification or acceptance. So far, 19 countries have ratified the agreement.\nMany others, including the United States and China, have publicly committed to joining the Paris Agreement this year.",

        "text": "In most farms across the country, the rains stopped midway and now the crops have wilted. [PHOTO: KIPSANG JOSEPH/STANDARD]\nClimate change is increasingly visible in Kenya and it plays a huge role in agriculture as it threatens production. Smallholder farmers depend on natural resources like rain, sunlight and soil for their production activities. These resources are adversely affected by climate change as indicated by the changing seasonal weather patterns and occurrences of extreme weather events. The normal bi-annual rainfall pattern is under siege thus disrupting farming plans and cropping calendars.\nThe country is confronted with a range of climatic risks that have far-reaching consequences for its agricultural systems. Rapid and uncertain changes in rainfall and temperature patterns markedly threaten food production, this will lead to food price shocks, increase vulnerability of small holders, and accentuate rural poverty.\nWhere climate change is most obvious, and extremely concerning for farmers, is the rain cycles which have become so erratic that farmers don't know when to plant anymore. This year, we had no rain for four months from January to April. This is highly unusual, as this used to be known as the rainy season in Kenya. On the other extreme end, some regions have been experiencing highly unusual periods of frost and heavy hail.\nErratic rains\nBased on this year's climate, we've known for some time already that 2016 is going to be a disastrous year for yields. As I write this article maize farmers are up in arms as rains have failed at a critical stage of the growing period as a result crop has wilted leaving farmers' hopeless and counting huge losses. Farmers have reported that the crop have wilted.\nA decline in precipitation is the current day phenomenon. Rainfall is the most important climatic factor critical for the survival of crops growth and livestock herds. A period of low rainfall means a period of scarcity of feeds and water, and increased walking distance for pastoralists.\nIf you think the prolonged dry spell is the only worry for farmers, then wait until you hear how difficult the erratic rainfall can be to farmers. The rains come with floods and sweep all the fertile top soil downstream leaving the ground bare. With the depleted soils, it is difficult to grow and produce healthy crops. Flooding is another disaster associated with these erratic rains. Floods come with all sorts of heath-related problems besides suffocating the crops. It is during this period when malaria and cholera cases increase.\nTemperatures have also been rising. Evidence of progressive warming is obvious across the country and continent. As temperatures rise, rainfall patterns change and variability increases, farmers need to grow different times, grow different crops, use different inputs, raise different animals and be ready for ongoing changes.\nAs a result of these changes, farmers would see lower crop yields. Maize, wheat and sorghum are all sensitive to high temperatures. Increase in aridity would see farmers lose part of their crop lands used to grow maize, millet and sorghum. Less food would be available to eat and malnutrition would increase.\nAdaptation strategies\nThese effects of climate change add to the challenges facing Kenyan farmers in producing enough food for the country's growing population. The change is making worse the already tight resource constraints facing smallholders, and more erratic weather patterns and extreme weather events are decreasing average yields.\nSometimes natural calamities like prolonged droughts affecting food security, have forced the government to respond in an emergency manner and allocate funds for climate change adaptation, though this is for short term adaptation measures mostly.",

        "text": "Climate change has become a topic of great interest in the current setting.\nThis is due to the diabolical effects associated with it that have affected life.\nFood insecurity, increased natural disasters including floods, prolonged drought, increased disease outbreak, resource conflicts, water shortage and threatened source of livelihood.\nThe reality of climate change is no longer in question.\nSince a global consensus has been reached marking the culmination of the Sustainable Development Goals and the consistent agreements within the Conference of Parties (COP) mainly on adaptation, mitigation and financing for the climate change agenda.\nAccording to research, the non- annex 1 countries with an example of Kenya are among the worst affected by climate change. High levels of poverty and underdevelopment combined with insufficient infrastructure exacerbate the already severe impact of global warming on resources, development and human security. In order to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change, the developing economies like Kenya are expected to implement more robust environmental policies, increase local human capacity and encourage renewable energy entrepreneurship. Within international fora, they must better coordinate their position as some of the smallest contributors to global warming and locally seek to mainstream climate change through innovation and technology.\nTo prevent uncontrollable changes of climate, concerted efforts have been proposed primarily geared towards stabilization of green-house gases at a level equivalent to double the pre-industrial CO--2. These efforts are however predicted to have no counter-productive response in a population increasing world by 2050 which only raises concerns on the magnitude to which emission reduction measures should be undertaken. This will involve efficiency in energy policy that controls per capital energy consumption as well as energy source type.\nAlthough efforts have been made to determine efficient, clean, cost- effective and productive energy sources, it is unclear which path to take: hydro-electric power expansion in use has been precluded by environmental concerns, biomass expansion has been plagued with human rights concerns since it requires vast areas of land possibly infringing rights to food as well as natural ecosystem preservation (Biomass- food production -ecosystem preservation competition), as well as solar photovoltaic and wind power economic competitiveness concerns especially distribution viability with distance and storage cost. Further considerations that deem currently non-viable and early-in-stage have been the 'decarburization' of fossil fuels which involves removing and sequestering carbon dioxide----1.\nThe concerns of fossil fuel as primary determiners of climate change has been for long been researched. Initially there were suggestions that the burning of fossil fuel results to emission of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide which has warming and cooling effects respectively; a phenomenon that could lead to offsetting one another's effect on climate. The claim however was contrasted after thorough intervention of the green- house effect especially the sky radioactive effects2 and the cloud albedo modification 3.\nEnergy crisis is one of the greatest challenges in Kenya. An oil- dependent nation like Kenya which historically import an approximation of 80,000 barrels of oil a day4 has been plagued by corruption and high costs; the two burdensome threats that affect growth in the country. Such high fuel dependence in products production and transport logistics results to high cost of production which is ultimately reflected on commodity price crisis. When this applies to food transport and production, right to food is massively infringed.\nBurning of fossil fuel in production and transportation as well as the use of organic fertilizer in agriculture creates environmental pressures that threaten land use and productivity. Water shortage and safety are some of the challenges that seem to continue affecting communities especially the poor and the marginalized. This has been a source of conflicts within communities.\nWith the advocacy of the adoption of renewable clean energy, Kenya which has faced macro-economic challenges especially high unemployment rate with a high percentage being the youths creates a greater incentive to offset these. Following renewable investment including wind power, solar, nuclear investment as well as hydro- power creates a great platform for innovation and inventions among the youths.\nWith the discovery of oil and coal deposits in Kenya, a great concern remains whether our 'break-free' pleas would be taken into consideration, but with freedom of speech and role the media plays in influencing change there is great hope in influencing mitigation activities among the communities and professional through knowledge management and information dissemination.",

(PHOTO: COURTESY)\nYou are more likely to die from the effects of climate change than global conflicts, says a new report.\nTitled Healthy Environment, Healthy People, the report was compiled by the United Nations Environmental Programme (Unep), World Health Organisation, the Convention on Biological Diversity, Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions.\nIt was presented at the United Nations Environmental Assembly that met in Nairobi last week. The multi-sectoral report estimates that environmental degradation and pollution cause up to 234 times as many premature deaths as occur in conflicts annually, highlighting the importance of a healthy environment in achieving the 2030 Agenda.\nThe report found that in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions, or 23 per cent of the total.\nThis is three times the current population of Nairobi. Delegates were told how climate change is exacerbating the scale and intensity of environment-related health risks. Estimates from WHO indicate that 250,000 additional deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050, mostly from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress, as a result of climate change.\nAccording to the report, a simple act such as preparing a meal for the family can prove fatal due to inhaling poor quality air. \"In some countries, preparing a meal is a major risk to health because of indoor air pollution. Some 4.3 million deaths are attributed to household air pollution arising from cooking with solid fuels. Nearly all of these deaths occur among people living in low- and middle-income countries,\" it said, noting that three billion people, mostly in rural communities, rely on solid fuels such as firewood and coal.\nAchim Steiner, UNEP executive director, said by depleting the ecological infrastructure of the planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever growing cost in terms of human health and well-being. \"From air pollution and chemical exposure to the mining of our natural resource base, we have compromised our life support systems,\" he said.",

A report titled Fueling the Fire gives references to big corporations that bankrolled COP 21. This in itself is a major conflict of interest. Several civil societies have likened it to the scenario of a fox guarding a henhouse. It is therefore clear that oil corporations have captured climate talks.\nFrom aggressive lobbying at the regional level to financial sponsorship of international meetings, the industry interferes at all levels. Industry cooptation of treaty meetings has been a growing problem and a primary obstacle to progress.\nAt COP21 in Paris, industry interference was a central concern. The meetings, dubbed the \"Corporate COP,\" were financially sponsored by dozens of corporations with massive carbon footprints and track records of undermining sound climate policy.\nThis rampant interference should be addressed if we are to drastically reduce the effects of climate change which is felt in the world over. Big polluters must be kicked out of climate talks.\nKenya's commitment to reduce its green House gas emissions by 30% by 2030 is a tall order for a developing country. It continues to show commitment to address climate change by putting in place the right policies as well as collaborating with various stakeholders including researchers.

This is one of the ways in which a segment of the populace cushions itself from the vagaries of economic upheavals.\nHowever, financial experts are worried that climate change - that elephant in room that many ignored - may have far-reaching financial risks than ever thought.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, businesses around the world are interested in stress tests to determine how different climate scenarios will affect such long-term savings and whether there is a need for additional capital defence mechanisms.\nTheir concern is that banks, insurance companies and pension funds may lose value due to policies designed to reduce carbon emissions mainly from fossil fuels.\n\"Institutions such as the Bank of England, the Financial Stability Board and the European Systemic Risk Board are examining how banks, insurers and pension funds would cope if policies designed to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions led to a sharp drop in the share price of oil, gas and coal companies,\" said the journal.\nFuel deposits\nThese fears are legitimate considering that the recently-concluded international climate deal in Paris aims to contain average temperatures at 1.5 degrees, meaning that more fossil fuel deposits would have to remain underground, sending shock waves in stocks invested in oil and gas.\nKenya, for example, has an economy that relies heavily on oil. The recent drop in international prices of oil has been a boon to motorists on one hand while investors in the sector cried foul on the other hand.\nOil reserves\nThe above concerns will no doubt have a bearing on the country that is currently investing heavily in the oil sector after the recently discovered oil reserves in the northern part of the country. In addition, there are huge coal deposits at the Mui Basin in Kitui.\nA collapse in the value of fossil fuel-based assets will no doubt send the country back to the drawing board.",

        "text": "Some of the victims of cholera outbreak at Ligega health center in Ugunja Siaya county. Four people have died while 23 others hospitalized in the county following the outbreak of the disease.\nGiven recent warm temperatures, cholera outbreaks could become more frequent, scientists have warned. And as Kenya faces a cholera outbreak in about a dozen counties countrywide, moderate increase in sea temperatures and levels associated with global warming naturally suggest possibility of increased public health concerns like cholera and Hepatitis A.\nKenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) Chief Research Officer Andrew Githeko is leading a team of scientists to research on the effect of climate on bacteria that causes cholera that thrives in temperatures ranging from 25 to 30 degrees centigrade. \"When the weather gets warmer, it creates a conducive environment for bacteria and viruses to multiply in food and water, causing disease,\" said Dr Githeko, Kemri Head of Climate and Human Health Research Unit at Centre for Global Health Research.\nHe linked higher temperatures due to climate change to increase in water-linked diseases like cholera, malaria and dengue. \"Unusually warm weather in February and March if followed by heavy rains in April and May leads to malaria and cholera outbreaks, as was seen in 1997 and 1998,\" he said.\nAs these micro-organisms thrive, he said, poor hygiene and sanitation, which include lack of proper disposal of solid and liquid waste from humans and households and poor hand-washing habits expose populations to these food and water-borne diseases. High water tables also cause latrines to flood, prompting disease.\nDr Githeko found out that most cholera outbreaks occur after increased rainfall and warm temperatures, thus arriving at the conclusion that climate plays a key role in modulating the size of outbreaks and as it gets hotter, water-borne diseases like cholera and vector-borne diseases like malaria flourish.\nThe scientist gave an example of a two-fold increase in cholera cases in Zanzibar between 1997 and 2006 after a one degree centigrade increase in temperature at four months' interval, and an increase of 200mm in rainfall at two months' period resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in cholera cases.\nHe identified some diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, Hepatitis A and E, that are sensitive to climate change and variability, further warning that compromised water and food-handling habits especially during these soaring temperatures is fertile ground for more outbreaks.\n\"Due to the warm weather, individuals are also consuming more water, unaware whether it is properly treated. Food handling is also compromised, thus it is a fertile ground to transmit water and food borne diseases,\" he added in an interview with The Standard on Saturday.\nAccording to Dr Githeko, climate change is a regional other than local event. He cites the 1997/98 cholera epidemic that affected populations living around the shores of Lake Victoria, leading to the ban of fish from the region to European markets. And as climatologists predict a 1.4 to 5.8 degree centigrade rise in mean temperatures over the next 100 years, Dr Githeko advises that with expertise on predictive weather patterns, being forewarned will shield Kenya from adverse effects of public health outbreaks.\nWhile cholera has not been heard in most developed countries in the last five decades, Kenya is currently dealing with recent outbreaks, with about 17 counties having successfully contained the public health concern. Another 12 are fighting further spread.\nAnd just what is the relationship between Hepatitis A and cholera? Both diseases are caused by compromised food and water hygiene standards. Hepatitis A virus is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and water or through direct contact with an infectious person, whereas cholera is caused by Vibrio cholerae, a bacteria that normally lives in water.\nIn May last year, disease surveillance officers in Nakuru found a majority of persons from cholera-affected households who had died and others being treated had consumed Busaa prepared in unhygienic conditions.",

It worked that time. The reason why it is less possible to predict rain and drought now is because the planet is warming and causing climate change.\"\nGenerally, it is argued, that global warming is riding on high carbon footprint as the world exploits fossil fuels.\nAccording to Felister, farmers should care about climate change and start adopting better farming practices and using seed varieties that can withstand erratic climatic conditions.\nIn October 2014, at a seminar in Wundanyi, researchers from the International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology (Icipe) argued that climate change is no longer a theory but a reality whose effects are already being felt.\nThe team warned farmers from Taita Taveta that they will face serious hunger due to global warming if they (farmers) do not modernise their practices.\nBridgite Nyambo, a senior researcher at Icipe, said their findings indicate that although the area exhibits good rainfall levels as one progresses upwards, farmers still face major hurdles in producing enough food - and this can be attributed to changing weather patterns.\nNyambo, a professor of ecology and entomology, said farmers have to \"change tack and be smart\" to remain food secure.\nAs the government mitigates the challenge of global warming, farmers have to work alongside these efforts. They ought to plant food crops that can survive the weather, as well as include practices like terracing, rotating fields, mulching and agro-forestry, it emerged.\nFelister says seed varieties produced through research will be a good starting point to assure food security even with climate change.",

Being able to land at sea would give the company flexibility to recover rockets used on more demanding missions, such as launching heavy satellites, when boosters do not have enough fuel left to reach land.\nSunday's SpaceX launch succeeded in its primary goal to put the U.S.- and European-owned Jason-3 satellite into orbit 830 miles (1,336 km) above the planet.\nThe 1,200-pound (550 kg) spacecraft is the fourth in a series of ocean-monitoring satellites taking center stage in monitoring Earth's climate.\n\"More than 90 percent of all the heat being trapped in the Earth's system ... is actually going into the ocean,\" said Laury Miller, Jason-3 lead scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"This makes the ocean perhaps the biggest player in the climate change story.\"\nNOAA is one of five agencies partnering on the $180 million, five-year Jason-3 program.\nJason-3 is designed to bounce radio waves off the ocean and time how long it takes the reflected signals to return. Scientists can use the information to figure out ocean heights to within 0.2 inches (0.5 cm), said Josh Willis, with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\"This is one of the most important yardsticks we have for human-caused climate change,\" Willis said, adding that heat, plus runoff water from melting ice sheets, causes ocean levels to climb.",

        "text": "The largest gathering of world leaders came to a halt this December 2015 that was aimed at striking an ambitious deal on the effects of climate change.\nClimate change is a big cause for water scarcity around the globe.\nBut let's focus first things first.\nMany human beings across the world are facing inadequate access to water.\nIn the USA for instance, the State of California has been worse hit by drought in the recent months due to shortage of rains.\nHaving been born and raised in Kenya, I can attest to the shortage of water and its consequences to millions of people across the African continent not to mention other developing countries.\nGoing by the above facts, there is an urgent need to reason together and ask ourselves questions regarding the issue of water scarcity not only in Africa but across the world, as well. Human beings need water to survive and so are other living things and organisms. The big question is how is water useful to the living things across the globe? What actions do we need to take in order to ensure that these living things have adequate supply of water resources? You will bear me witness that water scarcity is contributed by many factors such as, demand for water, high rate of population, corrupt government institutions, lack of clear water policies, pollution and climate change to mention a few.\nThe issue of water is an issue that is close to my heart preferably because of my first-hand experience with the topic. As noted above, my personal view experience was not a smooth one. I was born and raised in a small town called Makueni in the eastern part of Kenya. Growing up in the village, we hardly had access to water- let alone clean water. We would go for days without taking a bath or washing clothes. The small quantity of water that was available was only reserved for cooking and drinking only. The water that was available for cooking was from rivers where our mothers would walk miles of distances away to go fetch it. I must admit that the water was not very clean and no one bothered to boil it before cooking or drinking.\nGenerally, it is not secret that there has been water scarcity not only in my home country Kenya but Africa as a whole for many decades now. Only a small percentage of the continent's land is used for agriculture, with the rest of the year-round climate been arid. On the other hand, there are hardly any natural water resources that can provide equitable delivery of water to the many regions across the continent. It is devastating to note that , a majority of the people in this continent walk several miles of distances in search of water- many of them been women and children.\nThe above challenges of water lead to ask myself some mind boggling questions such as, is there anything that can be done to solve the issue of water in developing countries across the world once and for all? As much as I acknowledge that the water challenge is facing other developed countries like United States, we must admit that the water problem is majorly affecting a majority of developing countries. Population growth and economic development has also caused water shortage in many countries especially the developing countries across the world. As population grows, there is always an increase of demand for water. There is need for proper water management. According to the United Nations, water scarcity affects every continent.\nThe buck stops with the respective government institutions bestowed and mandated by the people with the responsibility of governance and policy making roles which are supposed to be geared towards providing the people with adequate access to water. Believe you me; most governments in Africa are faced with corruption. In each and every government, there are specific departments of water. These departments are supposed to play crucial roles of ensuring that they channel funds and monetary values towards providing access of water to the people. In my opinion, every government is supposed to dig wells, dams or boreholes that can generate water and serve its people. There are water supply and sanitation problems as well, that need to be addressed. Instead, the funds set aside for this purposes are channelled to people's pockets and none of the leaders are ready to account for the lost funds. Corruption in these governments is driving people to problems.\nI must acknowledge the fact that there are hundreds if not thousands of individuals, and non-governmental organizations popularly known as NGOs that have been on the forefront of providing access to water to a majority of the people lacking this precious commodity. These organizations, have begun the process of funding many water projects by either developing and expanding the current water sources or investing to start new water projects such as digging boreholes and dams. With these initiatives, the people have resorted to doing small scale farming such as planting vegetables towards making a difference in their lives.\nMy position about water scarcity issue revolves around initiating real actions that will combat water scarcity around the globe. Here is why, for the world to make progress about the challenges and the scarcity of water facing many countries across the globe we have to accept that there is a problem. The problems include some of the above issues I have addressed above such as corruption in the water sector, climate change, agriculture, pollution and population growth and economic development. I believe that there can be tangible solutions to the problem of water scarcity. I can envision that there is need for addressing this issue. Nothing is impossible if we decide to incorporate experts, professionals, governments, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders alike in the water sector in order to address the water issue once and for all.\nAccording to the United Nations, water scarcity is a real threat. At least 1.1 billion people lack access to water and 2.6 billion lack adequate sanitation; most of these populations are in developing countries. The question here is, will these numbers decrease or will they keep increasing? What solutions can be taken to ensure that these people get access to water resources? Another important question I ask myself is, what can I personally do to use less water? I realized that the solution to water scarcity starts with me. I have to take measures such as reducing the amount of water I use for domestic use as well as fixing leaks both indoors and outdoors in the house.\nWater scarcity affects all social and economic sectors. I insist that real solutions and actions are needed in order to address the issue of water crisis. The solutions ought to take into consideration factors such as development, supply, use and demand and an emphasis on the people and their livelihoods. There are millions of people today going without water in many parts of the world such as in Kuwait, China, South Africa, Kenya, United States, Peru, Mexico, Senegal- to mention a few. The causes of water crisis in these countries are well known to us and include among other things, pollution, demand for water, climate change, corrupt government institutions, high population growth and the list is endless. We cannot afford to give up on the issues that cause water scarcity. This calls for coming up with real solutions aimed at curbing water scarcity throughout the world. We can use technology to make water from air such as in the case of a Dutch Company making water from air. The idea is working because the company has had two prototypes in operation for two years, one in the Netherlands and the other in Kuwait, which are producing an average of 7,000 litres a day of water - without any electricity. The other solution is by cutting water usage such as in California where cities and water agencies are being required to cut water use by varying amounts ranging from 8 percent to 36 percent. Not to forget stabilizing or moving the overgrowing population of people. And lastly but not least, the work of encouraging more corporations and Non-Governmental Organizations to partner with existing organizations and various government agencies to continue making availability of water to those deserving around the globe.",

        "text": "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), majority of the human population in the world live in urban areas. In 2014, the urban population accounted for 54% of the total global population which is equivalent to 3.96 Billion and it is expected to grow by an average of 1.63% per year between now and 2030.\nClimate change poses new multiple challenges to the urban setting and the greatest major concern to humanity being the health risks from the impacts of climate change. And these include flooding, scarcity of water, heat stress and lack of food among others. Majority of these adverse climate change effects are being experienced by the poor and the low income communities who have poor disaster preparedness capability and response. Developing countries are the most vulnerable because of low capacity to handle the disaster risk issues and poor disaster preparedness capabilities.\nA report published by the Global Humanitarian Forum in 2009 estimated more than 300,000 deaths and about 125 Billion USD in losses each year, most of which was in developing countries. With the growth in population expected to rise by 2030, there is an anticipated major urban population health risk through death and losses.\nClimate change and its associated natural health stressors which influences human health and disease that include severe weather, air pollution, and water quality, impact in water and food supply and environmental degradation is expected to influence human health in numerous ways. Some existing health threats will intensify and new health threats will emerge. These include increased respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, injuries and premature deaths related to extreme weather events, changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution of food, water-borne illnesses, infectious diseases and threats to mental health.\nThere is therefore need to build urban resilience to counter the rising effects of climate change with the anticipated urban population growth by the year 2030, a wider range of preparedness strategies and measure resilience. Cities must become resilient to a wider range of shocks and stresses in order to be prepared for climate change impacts; and efforts to foster climate change resilience must be bundled with efforts to promote urban development and sustainability.\nResiliency must be in terms of responding to equity concerns associated with uneven patterns of resilience both within and across cities, responding to dynamic changes of climate change impacts, assessing the costs of implementing resilience strategies, advocacy, health system strengthening and identifying options for harnessing the innovation potential in cities as a means to foster resilience and sustainability.\nThis will form the fundamental step towards an effective, sustainable and equitable adaptation of cities to climate change impacts especially on human health by the year 2030.",

The ongoing El Nino rain that has caused untold sufferings to many Kenyans speaks volumes about the ravages and vagaries of climate change.\nAs a matter of fact, climate change has disrupted the supply chain thus increasing the cost of raw materials and energy. Excessive greenhouse emissions deplete the ozone layer hence unprecedented global warming.\nGlobal warming knows no territorial boundaries and developing countries are the main victims of greenhouse emissions. For instance, according to scientists, deforestation is responsible for about 20 per cent of world's greenhouse gas emissions and has adverse impact on ecosystem and biodiversity.\nIndustrialised nations are the real environmental villains and therefore should be in forefront of mitigating the effects of climate change.\nIn order to reduce the greenhouse emissions, the global citizens should join hands and invest in renewable natural resources.",

        "text": "Dear Mr. President, The International Climate Conference (COP 21) is coming and world leaders will come together for climate negotiations in Paris on November 30 - December 11.\nAs a requirement, Kenya submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), ahead of the Conference of the Parties.\nBy the Conference of the Parties (COP20) in Lima, Parties are to agree what up-front information should be provided for clear, transparent and understandable contributions.\nMr. President, The Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released earlier this year, is a sobering reminder that climate change is unequivocal, that it is essentially driven by human activity, and that it represents one of the biggest challenges of our time.\nIt therefore warns on the risks of inaction as being too high to be ignored, and the effects of global warming can already be felt in many aspects of human life.\nThis fifth Emissions Gap report, while it updates the 2020 emissions gap analysis, it gives particular attention to the implications of the global carbon dioxide emissions budget for staying within the 2 C limit beyond 2020.\nIt does so because countries are giving increasing attention to where they need to be in 2025, 2030 and beyond.\nThere is inefficient and wasteful production systems in Kenya, Mr. President leading to unsustainable utilization of natural resources resulting in their degradation in the country .\nFurther, the poor enforcement of policies and regulations governing production and marketing hinder economic growth and the attainment of its optimal performance, this is what the INDCs says.\nAdding that the environment sector has a number of challenges which include; frequent droughts, natural disasters, acute water shortages, climate change and variability, loss of biodiversity and poor waste management systems.\nThis has resulted in land degradation and loss of forest cover which currently stands at a mere 1.7 per cent of the total territorial surface area falling far below the globally recommended 10 per cent minimum cover.\nThe INDC states that Kenya seeks to abate its emissions by 30% by 2030, relative to Business As Usual (BAU) scenario of 143MtCo2eq.\nThe INDC is part of the accounting framework for the post-2020 mitigation contributions, whose four key areas are ;- understanding and accounting for non-GHG and multiple contributions; minimizing double counting; accounting for GHG impacts of actions taken in the land sector and ; the timing of decisions on accounting issues.\nSo the pre-2020 period the information guidance has to be (a) Ensure clear and transparent\n(b) Provide information on expected national emissions levels for the post-2020,\n(c) Provide information on expected national GHG emissions reductions for the post-2020 period,\n(D) Provide information on expected long-term transformational impacts.\nThese availed information is to be the basis for tracking progress in implementation of mitigation contributions and actual GHG emissions reductions to be achieved in the post-2020.\nThis includes;\n(a) track progress towards contributions.\n(b) provide information on actual national GHG emissions levels.\n(c) provide information on actual national GHG emissions reductions achieved.\n(d) provide updated information on expected long-term transformational impacts.\nThe INDC has a chart for information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding, which provides for an implementation framework for 2030.\nBut the chart lacks information compared to the accounting for GHG framed mitigation contributions for pre-2020 upfront information that requires that; headline number, contribution type, and timeframe; base year or baseline; scope of sectors and coverage of gases; treatment of the land sector , and expected transfers of GHG units and/ or mitigation outcomes.\nFor the post-2020 tracking what is required is GHG inventories, accounting for emissions and removals from the land sector; and actual International transfers of GHG units via market mechanisms or mitigation outcomes via market approaches.\nAdaptation finance tracking requires information on sector, potential impacts and response activity.\nCauses of climate change such as air pollution, water pollution, waste production, pollution from fossil fuels, mining, increase in carbon dioxide- soil erosion, extinction of species, faulty consumption patterns, housing and food security issues and over use of resources, have to be clear.\nThe price of climate induced loss and damage is already being felt in developing countries. When damage happens, infliction is said to be huge, with most people losing crops.\nAfrica's Adaptation Gap report 2, estimates that loss and damage will cost twice as much as adaptation across Africa.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), underscores that climate change exacerbates threats, making delivering on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agenda more difficult because of reversing positive, trends, new uncertainties or mounting costs of resilience.\nThe Road to Dignity by 2030, notes that the threats that face us, and new opportunities that present themselves, demand a high level of ambition and truly participatory responsive and transformational course of action.\nWhat are the consequences of delayed action? The consequences of postponing stringent emission reductions will be additional costs and higher risks to society.\nMary Manneko Monyau, AfDB, described the Bank's support to African countries to seize low-carbon resilient growth opportunities through the provision of increased climate finance of up to US$5 billion annually by 2020.\nHighlighting energy as a priority, she stressed that Africa is tired of \"being in the dark,\" and called for, inter alia: \"ambitious, not ambiguous commitments\"; practical solutions for climate resilience in Africa; and increased access to multilateral climate funds and mobilization of domestic funds.\nMonica Karangi, Kenya Institute of Public Policy, Research and Practice, has noting that Africa's low contribution to carbon emissions \"is not an excuse,\" stressing emissions are growing due to increased urbanization, expanding economies and a \"heavy policy bias\" towards motorization.\nUsing Nairobi as a case study, she lamented that the last land-use plan dates back to 2002 and that promising policy initiatives, such as the Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system, have not been implemented due to opposing interests.\nOn his part, John Nyangena, Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis, on an analysis of Kenya's Climate Change Fund (CCF), has highlighted key challenges including a lack of definitions and targets for funding adaptation and CCF allocation within existing national funding mechanisms.\nTherefore, Mr.President , the Kenyan INDC does not reflect the reality of the range of actions the country is planning to undertake.\nIt fails to enable the public to appreciate the scale of the challenge faced by the country in its overall planned actions/intended contributions\nIt has not prioritized its intended actions, in the context of limited financial, technical and human re-sources, and that thus there will be a different mixture or combination of types of actions/contributions (mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, other sustainable development), depending on the level of resources available.\nIt does not show the level of external resources required if the country is to attain certain levels of actions in the various categories of actions/contributions.",

        "text": "The historic climate talks in Paris have come to a joyous end and full details are now available.\nOne hundred and ninety six nations agreed to take unprecedented action that will lower global warming by 1.5 Celsius and enhance low carbon economic growth that feeds on clean, green energy.\nThe Big Q is, how exactly can we as a continent tap into the $100 billion a year in climate aid pledged as part of this Paris agreement by 2020?\nAccording to the Paris agreement, this money should be, 'be consistent with a pathway towards low emission and climate resilient development, in the context of sustainable development priorities and efforts to eradicate poverty.'\nThe billions will come from both public and private sources. The United Nations Framework on Convention on Climate Change notes that 1,000 investors are committed to climate action covering 30 billion of assets. Among them are big banks that are stepping up their investments not just in traditional green areas like renewable and clean energy but also in fairly recent areas like green bonds. Other investment destinations are low-emission transport and agriculture.\nOne of the mega financial institutions that is walking in this direction is the French Cre?dit Agricole CIB, which will avail $60 billion in new climate finance by the end of 2018. The French multinational Bank BNP Paribas has also committed $16 billion.\nFollowing suit is a French coalition that includes Societe General, Total and Orange. This coalition announced new bank and bond financing of 80 billion for climate change projects.\nBank of America will increase its low carbon business to $125 billion by 2025 through instruments like lending, investing and advisory services for clients around the world, including Kenya.\nIn addition, 500 institutions that control $3.4 trillion in assets are behind the Fossil Fuel Divestment Campaign. Divesting from fossil fuel means investing in renewable energy and other low carbon ventures. Bill Gates and other members of the billionaires club are also supporting 20 countries in mission innovation, an initiative that is mobilising billions of dollars towards energy research.\nSo how can Kenyans access all these funds?\nIt's simple - by initiating low-carbon macro businesses. Show how you will move your one-million shilling energy efficient cookstove project into a one-billion shilling similar venture and you can play in this league.\nDon't buy another matatu but get together with one hundred others and start putting up a wind farm and you can play in this league. If you are a university, come up with a research programme that will deliver more renewable energy and energy efficiency, and you can play in this league. This is real.\nThink Green, Act green!",

Adaptation means preparing for the extreme weather events and natural disasters that will be caused by rising global temperatures.\n\"What Africa needs is funds for adapting.

        "text": "Global warming has increasingly become the leading concern in the world. That the world's climate is changing for the worse is no longer a matter of conjecture or preserve of scientific discourse.\nOver the last couple of decades, meteorologists and other climatologists have raised the red flag, warning us of the ticking time bomb if we do not take urgent measures to curb rising temperatures.\nWorld leaders have also taken up the mantle, with US President Barack Obama taking the lead by recently reactivating the US Climate Action Plan (CAP). The CAP was unveiled on June 25th, 2013. This comprehensive plan is the first of its kind and was developed by US Government to strategically achieve three overarching goals: cut domestic carbon pollution, prepare the US for climate change impacts, and lead international efforts to address global climate change.\nAlthough there are several reasons and theories that have been attributed to this spectacle man's socio-economic activities are at the epicentre. They include burning of fossil fuels, especially in industrial production and unbridled deforestation. This has led to the so-called \"greenhouse effect\" by thinning the ozone layer, the atmospheric layer that shields the earth against the vagaries of direct sun rays.\nThe effects of climate change are deep and far reaching. In Kenya, for instance, we have witnessed the swapping of seasons. It is now common for sunny spells in place of traditionally cold seasons, or to experience dry spells when it is supposed to be time for long rains. Floods and forest fires have also become a common occurrence in many regions around the world. This includes massive floods (El Nino) and prolonged droughts (La Nina). The arctic is now on a constant meltdown, leading to the rise of oceanic levels. Almost every region has had its fair share of environmental disasters as a result of global warming.\nBut beyond the environmental ramifications of climate change, there are moral and ethical questions being raised about the causes and effects of this phenomenon. This school of thought is led by Pope Francis who in recent times has taken a prominent role in appealing to global powers to rethink the current model of social and economic development. His blunt message is contained in his encyclical titled, \"Laudato Si' (Praised Be) of the Holy Father Francis on Care of our Common Home\", the first ever papal encyclical dedicated to environmental matters published on 18thJune 2015.\nIt is instructive that the Pope chose the name of the patron saint of animals and ecology, and has preached against environmental degradation since he was a cardinal in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Indeed, he is soon taking his message to global powers. On September 25, Pope Francis will formally address the UN General Assembly in New York. This year's assembly will involve huge decisions for its members on sustainable development and climate change.\nStill, in another first, the Pope will address a joint meeting of Congress on the day preceding the UN meet. At least 30 per cent of Congress members are Catholic. Here, the Pontiff is also expected to lobby for both environmental and social justice, including drastic changes in consumption by the world's wealthy nations.\nIn the 246-point encyclical, the Pope says that any effort to protect and improve our world entails profound changes in \"lifestyles,models of production and consumption, and the established structures of power which todaygovern societies\". He blames human selfishness, greedand social decadence as the main cause of degradation of the environment. Man has forgotten that he was created and put in this world for a higher calling and not as an end in itself.\nThe Pope observes that we are only addressing symptoms of climate change rather than its root causes. Adaptation and mitigation measures against global warming must include not only scientific and technological processes, but also spiritual and moral actions. We must sacrifice and be generous to future generations.\nThe writer is Executive Director of the Centre for Climate Change [email protected]",

        "text": "Kenya Forest Service Director Emilio Mugo\nUS President Barack Obama recently lauded Kenya for being in the forefront in the fight against climate change as well as environmental protection, initiatives crucial in socio-economic development.\nThe statement at Kasarani as he addressed a global audience puts Kenya in the community of nations that take climate change challenges seriously. The Kenya Forest Service (KFS) is in the forefront of promoting application of environmentally sustainable and people centered policies, strategies and measures aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation.\nThrough reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) process, the service seeks to provide an inclusive, transparent and equitable atmosphere for stakeholder participation. This will be in reducing deforestation and forest degradation, sustainable conservation of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. The process is a key vehicle as we continue to aim at achieving a 10 per cent forest cover by 2030. The forestry sector has been identified as holding the highest greenhouse gas abatement potential of any sector to provide low-cost greenhouse gas reduction solutions between now and 2030.\nInnovative strategies\nLocally, the REDD+ process seeks to support the country adopt new and innovative strategies, guidelines and policies to address deforestation, forest degradation and present new economic and social opportunities to both communities and the Government - both national and county governments in harnessing forestry resources.\nThe Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and KFS have taken REDD+ process forward by initiating the development of guidelines to support stakeholder engagement and the free, prior and informed consent. The guidelines will be key reference documents for demonstrating inclusive stakeholder participation and anchoring the consultation processes and safeguards under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .\nKenya's efforts to ensure readiness for REDD+ as a climate change mitigation process tallies aptly with President Obama's observation and our efforts in this direction continue to register progress in combating the vagaries of climate change.\nThe REDD+ is premised on the recognition that it will succeed only with the full involvement of take holders, including civil society organisations, marginalised and vulnerable groups, local communities and the private sector. This will happen through consultations at national and local level where land and other natural resource management decisions are ultimately made.\nKFS fully endorses the REDD+ readiness activities under development in the country, supported by United Nations REDD, Clinton Climate Initiative and other development partners and commits itself to the process.\nIt is my strong conviction that on successfully implemented, The REDD+ process will support Kenya adopt new innovative strategies and policies that will address deforestation and forest degradation - presenting new economic and social opportunities.\n-The writer is the Kenya Forest Service Director",

        "text": "President Barack Obama challenged America and the world to step up efforts to fight global warming on Monday at the formal unveiling of his administration's controversial, ramped-up plan to cut carbon emissions from U.S. power plants.\nDeclaring climate change the greatest threat facing the world, Obama said the regulation requiring the power sector to cut its emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 would reduce Americans' energy bills and improve the health of vulnerable populations nationwide.\nThe plan, which also mandates a shift to renewable energy from coal-fired electricity, is meant to put the United States in a strong position at international talks in Paris later this year on reaching a deal to curb global warming.\nThe United States has pledged to slash its greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Cuts from the high-emitting power sector will be critical to the effort, and the White House hopes this plan will prove Washington's commitment to that goal as it prods other countries to follow suit.\nObama is enacting the plan by executive order, bypassing Congress, which rejected legislative attempts to reduce pollution from carbon dioxide, a common greenhouse gas blamed by scientists for heating the earth.\nThe regulations face certain legal challenges from states and industries, and their long-term fate depends on their ability to withstand such challenges.\n\"We're the first generation to feel the impact of climate change. We're the last generation that can do something about it,\" Obama told a sympathetic audience at the White House.\n\"We only get one home. We only get one planet. There's no plan B.\"\nThe Clean Power Plan is intended to be a key part of the president's legacy on global warming, which he pledged to fight as a candidate for the White House in 2008.\nThe effort also sets up climate change as a political lightning rod in the 2016 presidential election.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, said she would defend the plan while Jeb Bush, one of a slew of Republicans running for their party's nomination, said it would cost people jobs.",

        "text": "The Kenya Climate Innovation Center (KCIC), an initiative of the World Bank and its global entrepreneurship program infoDev - has officially launched the first-ever support program for crowdfunding in East Africa.\nIn its pilot phase, the program has helped six clean-tech ventures design, develop, and launch their online crowdfunding campaigns.\nCrowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary contributions from a large number of people through an online platform. In developing countries, the market is in its infancy, but the potential is significant.\nThe World Bank/infoDev study-Crowdfunding's Potential for the Developing World- estimates that the market could reach up to US$90-96 billion per year by 2025. The results also show that from an income perspective the number of households in developing economies that could participate in crowdfunding ranges from 240 million to 344 million.\n\"By helping entrepreneurs connect with a global pool of investors, crowdfunding may represent a new tool that can address a funding problem faced by many local green ventures\" said Diarietou Gaye, World Bank Country Director Kenya. \"The development of a competitive clean technology sector will be instrumental toward a low-carbon economy and Kenya is taking important steps to reduce carbon emissions and increase resilience to climate change in accordance with its National Climate Change Action Plan.\nTo help Kenyan entrepreneurs tap into the crowdfunding market, the Kenya CIC, with the technical support of Crowdfund Capital Advisors (CCA) has developed a set of advisory services specifically designed to help local green ventures conduct effective crowdfunding campaigns and utilize the full range of crowdfunding platforms focused on African projects.\n\"Despite the growing number of small and medium-sized enterprises interested in crowdfunding in emerging markets, information and data on the topic is scarce and difficult to find,\" said Edward Mungai, CEO of the Kenya CIC. \"The ultimate goal of this project is to assist local ventures in making the most of this innovative form of financing.\"\nTo roll out the program, the Kenya CIC held a national pitching competition last August to select a first pool of local ventures that had 'crowdfunding potential'. The six winning companies-Wanda Organic, Global Supply Solutions, iCoal Concepts, Skynotch Energy Africa, Develatech, and the Human Needs Project-have received four months of mentorship and training to design and test their crowdfunding strategies. Four of these clean-tech ventures-Wanda Organic, Global Supply Solutions, iCoal Concepts, and Skynotch Energy Africa - just launched their campaigns on Indiegogo, while the other two will go live later in March.\nThe data captured by the Kenya CIC on these six companies and their campaigns will be a stepping stone to a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities of crowdfunding in the country.\nThe KCIC is part of infoDev's Climate Technology Program (CTP), which is currently implementing a global network of innovation centers across seven other countries.

        "text": "The world will not forgive leaders gathered in Rwanda this week if they fail to back a proposed agreement to cut greenhouse gases, a top UN official said on Thursday, calling the deal an easy one to achieve.\nRepresentatives from about 150 nations heard the appeal as they opened negotiations on a deal to phase down the use of factory-made hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases, which are used in refrigerators, air conditioners and aerosols.\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry was expected to join the conference later in the day. US officials said they were optimistic an agreement could be reached at the meeting ending on Friday.\n\"No one, frankly, will forgive you if you cannot find a compromise at this conference,\" said Erik Solheim, executive director of United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP).\n\"This is one of the cheapest, one of the easiest, one of the lowest-hanging fruits in the entire arsenal of climate mediation,\" he told the opening session in the Rwandan capital Kigali.\nScientists say a quick reduction of HFCs could dramatically slow climate change, avoiding perhaps 0.5 degree Celsius (0.9 Fahrenheit) of a projected rise in average temperatures by 2100.\nSolheim said failure to act would contribute to more extreme droughts and stronger storms of the type that hit Haiti last week, killing about 1,000 people. \"Expect more of this extreme weather if we don't fight against climate change,\" he said.\nAmong developing nations, India has been under the greatest pressure to sign a deal. It wants poor nations to be allowed to peak their HFC emissions in 2031 to avoid hurting growing industries.\nThe Kigali talks are part of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which helped protect the ozone layer by cutting the use of chlorofluorocarbons. The ozone layer shields the planet from ultraviolet rays that can cause skin cancer.\nThat deal prevented 2 million cases of skin cancer, Solheim said, adding he had been diagnosed with the disease himself.\nAn accord would be the third big step to curb global warming after the 2015 Paris Agreement.",

        "text": "As Kenya seeks to become industrialised by 2030, the environmental effects of economic growth are now giving economists sleepless nights. According to some studies, the damage might be irreversible.\nOne study, dubbed 'Environmental Kuznet Curve' by Dr Soumyananda Dinda of the Indian Statistical Institute of economic research, says the resultant pollution might leave countries like Kenya reeling in poor health, disabilities and deaths.\nThe study says developed countries easily afford to put their focus on environment as their economies grow, but the poor ones cannot. Scientists say that the developed countries must now help the poor ones.\nExperts believe that for developing countries to prosper without damaging the environment, they need substantial economic, technological and financial support from developed countries and the international community, to compensate for the economic losses associated with reducing pollution.\nThat argument has generated debate, with developing countries accusing the developed counterparts of creating the current pollution mess. At the heart of the problem is the fact that some of the accused developed countries have failed to ratify some international agreements, such as 2015's Paris Agreement.\nUS, CHINA SUPPORT\nLast week, developing countries such as Kenya breathed a sigh of relief after two of the biggest polluters in the world - China and USA - ratified the Paris Agreement. This means developing countries can now get USD100 billion (Sh10.1 trillion) climate funding every year until 2025. The funds will help turn the world into a zero-carbon, climate-resilient future.\nThe Paris Agreement makes it clear that developed countries will continue to provide and mobilise finance to support developing countries. Under the agreement, governments agreed to balance public funding between adaptation and mitigation, and agreed to significantly increase support for adaptation before 2020.\nAnd to ensure that there is transparency, countries have committed to improve reporting on finance, with everyone providing information about finance provided or received at an appropriate time. Depending on the impact of the funding, a higher budget may be adjusted after the expiry of time set.\nChina and USA represent almost 40 per cent of global carbon emissions (37.98 per cent). By any standard, their ratification of the Paris Agreement is one giant leap forward and a step closer to becoming a reality.\nAt least 195 countries have adopted the agreement so far, making it the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal. The agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2C. It is due to come into force in 2020.\nThe ratification by USA and China came into place after two weeks of intense discussion by more than 190 countries. Key elements in the Paris Agreement are mitigation on how to reduce impacts of climate change, transparency and global stock-taking, where governments come together every five years to set more ambitious targets, as required by science. Others are adaptation to climate change, loss and damage, role of cities, regions and local authorities in fighting climate change, as well as financial support to developing countries.\nThe Paris Agreement was opened for signature at the UN Headquarters in New York in April this year and will remain open until April 21 next year. To date, the agreement has been signed by 180 parties and ratified or otherwise joined by 26 parties, representing 39 per cent of global emissions.\nYET TO RATIFY\nFor the agreement to enter into force, 55 parties representing at least 55 per cent of global emissions must join. It is set to enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 Parties to the Convention, accounting in total for at least an estimated 55 per cent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions, have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.\nEU, the third-largest polluter producing 12.10 per cent of global emissions, as it represent 28 states, has not ratified, though it signed in April. India, the fourth-largest polluter, with 4.1 per cent of emissions, signed the agreement in April, too. Japan (3.79 per cent), Brazil (2.48 per cent), Canada (1.95 per cent), South Korea (1.85 per cent) and Indonesia (1.49 per cent) are the other six largest polluters who have not ratified, even though they all signed in April.\nThe effects of a changing climate have already had an impact on people's livelihoods, country's wildlife and environment. Kenya's forest cover has significantly reduced due to the demands of a growing population which has led to deforestation, burning fossil fuels, and intensive farming.\nForests play a key role as when they are removed, a lot of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. Growing trees normally absorb it from the air. Greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also exchanged between forests and the atmosphere, so forests are a key component of the planet's greenhouse gases balance. As such, a functioning and well-managed forests are critical to efforts to reduce climate change ('climate change mitigation'), and reduce the net green house emissions into the atmosphere ('emissions abatement').\nREFORESTATION\nKeen to tap the resources from developed countries, Kenya on September 8 announced that it will restore 5.1 million hectares of degraded forests and landscapes by 2030. In areas with wildlife, human wildlife conflict has been an issue of concern, as human beings and wildlife scramble for the available resources.\nEnvironment CS Judi Wakhungu said Kenya is keen to benefit from funding towards mitigation and adaptation of climate change. \"This programme provides the most coherent and systematic effort to restore degraded forests and other landscapes, reduce poverty, improve food security, address climate change and conserve our valued biodiversity,\" she said during the launch at the Intercontinental Hotel.\nWakhungu said there is an urgent need to restore ecological integrity and functions of forests and landscapes, which have significantly lost their capacity to support livelihoods, environmental conservation and economic development.\n\"We have to find a balance between demand for resources and their sustainable supply. Climate change amplify these effects, making it harder for us to plan for the future,\" she said.\nWhile noting that a raft of laws have been developed to resolve some of the problems, Wakhungu said resources running into billions are needed if restoration is to be successful. She said forest lands in the country have a restoration potential of 5.2 million hectares, crop lands 7.6 million hectares, range lands 25.7 million hectares, roads 300,000 hectares.\nTHE BONN CHALLENGE\nCountries have also pledged to restore 150 million hectares of the world's deforested and degraded land by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030 under the Bonn Challenge.\nThe challenge is an implementation vehicle for national priorities, such as water and food security and rural development, while contributing to the achievement of international climate change, biodiversity and land degradation commitments.\nThe 2020 target was launched at a high-level event in Bonn in 2011 and was later endorsed and extended to 2030 by the New York Declaration on Forests of the 2014 UN Climate Summit.\nAnd during the just-concluded International Union for Conservation of Nature congress in Honolulu, Hawaii, countries also committed to increase restored degraded land by 2050.\nWith the latest pledges from Malawi and Guatemala, total Bonn Challenge pledges have now exceeded 113 million hectares, committed by 36 governments, organisations and companies.\nThe IUCN Congress put new issues on the global sustainability agenda, including the importance of linking spirituality, religion, culture and conservation, and the need to implement nature-based solutions - actions that protect and manage ecosystems, while effectively addressing societal challenges, such as food and water security, climate change, disaster risk reduction, human health and economic well-being.",

        "text": "A legion of organisations and experts advise African farmers and governments on how to make agriculture more productive and profitable. But after nearly six decades of public, private and donor investments, African farms are the least productive and African farmers are among the poorest people on the planet.\nAccording to Harvard's Calestous Juma, Africa imports nearly 83 per cent of its food. Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, spends about $5 billion (Sh506 billion) on food imports annually. In 2014, Africa spent over $35 billion (Sh3.5 trillion) on importing food. Moreover, Africa is also the largest recipient of food aid.\nAfrica is a hungry continent. In this country for instance, farmers, producers of food, can hardly afford two nutritious meals a day. Children who are born in rural farm households are often hungry, malnourished and stunted. It is estimated that 40 per cent of all children in sub-Saharan Africa are stunted from malnutrition, which hampers physical and cognitive development and deepens inter-generational poverty.\nLow farm productivity and the hunger associated with it have catastrophic economic and social consequences. For example, it is estimated that undernutrition causes 45 per cent of all child deaths in sub-Saharan Africa - 3.1 million deaths annually. Moreover, a study by the United Nations Economic Commission and World Food Programme estimates that Uganda loses about 5.6 per cent of its GDP because of malnutrition.\nThe story of Africa's chronic hunger and underperforming agricultural sector has existed side by side with the Africa Rising narrative over the past two decades. It is a tale of two continents; bustling cities with a surging middle class side by side with indelible hunger and debilitating malnutrition. Who really cares?\nThere is no shortage of honest, genuine do-gooders on the continent. Out of pity and the kindness of their hearts they have grappled with Africa's hunger crises for nearly a century. They come with the best ideas, solutions that have worked in their countries and other continents. Six decades after the Green Revolution transformed the Asian continent African farmers still cannot produce enough to food to feed their families.\nInterventions by a motley crowd of experts and development agencies have left mountains of failure but we have failed to get even a grain of wisdom. In many cases we have repeated the same old failed, idiotic interventions and expected different results.\nHonestly, I am baffled that in the 21st century, with everything we know about biodiversity, environmental services and climate change, we still have this crazy illusion that somehow a green revolution is a plausible formula for agricultural transformation in Africa.\nTo be fair, some things have worked and there are some bright spots. For example, why is the Kenya Tea Development Authority so successful when the coffee and pyrethrum sector collapsed? Why is a small dairy in peri-urban Nairobi so successful? Why are the small farms in the rolling slopes of Kisii more productive than the sprawling vast plains of Homa Bay?\nAfrica's agriculture and food potential is truly exceptional. Can we learn from the failures of the past six decades?",

        "text": "Sub-Saharan Africa is seeing a surge of interest in irrigation among small-scale farmers as climate change brings more erratic weather and as rising populations in countries from Nigeria to Kenya mean demand for a reliable harvest is growing, agriculture and water experts say.\nThe International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) estimates that more than a million hectares of small farms are now irrigated in the region, based on limited government data and satellite images.\nIn Tanzania, the area of small farms with access to irrigation has risen from just 33,500 hectares in 2010 to about 150,000 today, institute figures show.\nBut up to 29 million hectares in the East African nation alone potentially could be irrigated, said Ruth Meinzen-Dick, an IFPRI researcher.\nBoosts in irrigation could help protect the region's food security in the face of more extreme weather conditions driven by climate change, and be an engine of development, she and other experts said at the recent World Water Week gathering in Stockholm.\n\"Small-holder farmers' irrigation is a climate resilience option,\" said Dawit Mekonnen, an IFPRI researcher based in Ethiopia.\nRead: Kenya to plant 'green dress' size of Costa Rica in climate change fight\nScaling up\nIncreases in irrigation have been driven not only by more extreme weather conditions but by growing access over the last decade to more affordable Chinese-made water pumps, said Jennie Barron, a sustainable water researcher with the International Water Management Institute.\nBut expanding access to irrigation to a much higher number of farmers will require a range of other changes, from cuts to taxes on imported irrigation equipment to better training of farmers - particularly women - in the latest irrigation techniques, the researchers said.\nEnsuring women - who make up about half of Africa's agricultural labour force - have legal ownership of farmland is also key to ensuring they feel confident in making costly investments in irrigation, the experts said.\n\"Women are more disadvantaged because they lack control over assets,\" Barron said.\nMekonnen said access to irrigation is increasingly key to helping farmers in countries such as Ethiopia, Ghana and Tanzania provide enough food for their families throughout the year and get ahead financially by selling produce at dry times of year when demand and prices are highest.\nRoadblocks\nOne problem, he said, is that most sub-Saharan African countries have not yet mapped their most easily accessible groundwater resources, which makes it hard for small farmers to know what water is available.\nBoosting rainwater harvesting and building small dams to capture runoff may help many farmers in areas where groundwater is limited, the experts said.\nBecause pumping water requires energy, helping small-scale farmers get access to clean renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, will also be key to helping them afford to irrigate, Mekonnen said.\nRevolving funds - in which members join savings clubs and pool money to make loans to each other - and micro-credit loans also will be key to help small farmers afford irrigation equipment, the experts said.\nBut Tim Prewitt, the chief executive officer of charity organisation International Development Enterprises (iDE), said that financing of irrigation for small-scale farmers remains a challenge, in his organisation's experience.\n\"In Ghana we started working with 12 micro-finance organisations but only two are still with us,\" he said, in part because of problems ranging from defaults to high administrative costs.\nAccording to IWMI, only 7 percent of sub-Saharan Africa's farmland is irrigated, the lowest proportion of irrigation anywhere in the world.",

Spokesman Paul Gathitu said Makueni is one of the hot spots.\nHe spoke a day after the Kenya Meteorological Service released a three-month forecast showing the possibility of human-wildlife conflict occurring as a result of scramble for scarce resources. On Monday, Kenya Meteorological Service acting director Peter Ambenje said with adequate preparation, the country can avoid some of the negative impacts by taking advantage of the short rains expected.\nGathitu said even though they have not seen the forecast,they will use it to mitigate human-wildlife conflict.\n\"They have not given us the report but we will consider it as we plan for La Nina,\" he told the Star on the phone.\nLa Nina episodes represent periods of below average sea surface temperatures across the east-central Equatorial Pacific. It impacts the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns, which can lead to intense storm in some places and drought in others.\nHuman-wildlife conflict has been reported in Tsavo, Narok, Laikipia, Lamu, Kajiado and Meru.\nThe weather man said rainfall is expected to be distributed poorly as a result of ocean warming.\nAmbenje urged urged government agencies to liaise with livestock farmers. \"Close monitoring and contingency measures are necessary to cope with the situation,\" he said.

Kenya is a home to six unique world heritage sites identified by the Unesco.\nClustered in different categories, Kenya's heritage sites have been identified precisely because of their cultural, historical, natural and archaeological value.\nLamu Old Town, Fort Jesus, Kenya's lake system,Lake Turkana national parks, Mount Kenya National Park and the Mijikenda Kaya forest are Kenya's heritage sites, that are some of the country's tourist attraction.\nIn 2001, the World Heritage committee inscribed Lamu Old Town on the Unesco World Heritage List.\nLoading...\nThe town of Lamu began as a 14th century Swahili settlement, but the island has seen many visitors and influences, including Portuguese explorers, Turkish traders and the Omani Arabs.\nFort Jesus on the other hand was also inscribed in 2001 and is a National Monument, standing high over the Mombasa harbor. It was built by the Portuguese in 1593-1596 to the designs of Giovanni Battista Cairati to protect the port of Mombasa. It is one of the most outstanding and well preserved examples of the 16th Portuguese military fortification and a landmark in the history of this type of construction.\nLake Bogoria, Lake Nakuru and Lake Elementaita are Kenya's iconic Heritage having been inscribed in 2001.\nTurkana has in the recent past been referred to as the cradle of mankind after recent fossil evidence was unearthed at Koobi Fora. The region, which was inscribed as a heritage site in 1997, is one of the longest living histories on earth.\nApart from the breath-taking heritage sites,Kenya is also the home to the most iconic wildlife as well as species.\nThe report warns that hundreds of the world's heritage sites, usually sites to behold, risk being degraded by the impacts of climate change.\n\"Unequivocal scientific evidence shows that concentrations of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere, are greater now than at any time in the past 800,000 years and that global temperatures have increased by 1 degree celsius since 1880.As temperatures continue to rise, heat waves will worsen, extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent, oceans will continue to warm and acidify, and the rate of sea-level rise will increase,\"the report says.\nThe report adds that the direct and indirect impacts of climate change may present a threat to their outstanding universal value, integrity and authenticity.\nAccording to the report that was released during the just ended second session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) at Unep headquarters in Gigiri, climate change is a threat multiplier, and will increase vulnerability and exacerbate other stresses including, but not limited to, pollution, conflict over resources, urbanisation, habitat fragmentation, loss of intangible cultural heritage and the impacts of unplanned or poorly managed tourism.\nThousands of delegates from 174 countries, 120 at the ministerial level, took part in UNEA-2 and associated side events on issues of global importance, including the Sustainable Innovation Expo and the Science-Policy Forum from May 23-27.\nUNEA is the world's most authoritative decision-making body on the environment, tasked with tackling some of the most critical issues of our time. Creation of the Assembly means that the environment is now considered amongst the world's key concerns alongside other major global issues such as peace, security, finance and health.\nDuring the conference, far reaching decisions were reached on issues such as marine litter, the illegal trade in wildlife, air pollution, chemicals and waste, and sustainable consumption and production - which are an integral part of the global action needed to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement.\nAfter the Paris Agreement, one the most significant environmental agreements in recent decades, UNEA also agreed that Unep should accelerate support to countries, especially developing countries, to build national readiness capacity to implement the agreement, build implementation capacity and capacity to access finance and technology.\nUNEP outgoing executive director Achim Steiner said the decisions made will see a significant directional shift that will inform ministers' decisions in their home countries.\n\"We will now need to see the bold and decisive commitment observed at UNEA transmitted at the national level to drive forward the 2030 Agenda and ensure a brighter future for people and planet,\" he said.\nThe heritage report however, now paints a bleak future for the country especially the ailing tourism sector.\nIt says world heritage sites which are nature's partner, continue to play a critical role to country's development and the impacts of the climate change will hit them hard.\nAn economic survey for 2015 says tourism sector continued to be an important source of foreign exchange earnings in 2014. The economic survey says tourism experienced decreased performance owing to a number of factors such as insecurity mainly associated with terror attacks, adverse travel advisories and the spread of Ebola in West African countries.\nAccording to the 2015 survey report, tourism earnings decreased by 7.3 per cent from Sh 94.0 billion in 2013, to Sh 87.1 billion in 2014 as a consequence of the challenges faced. This was attributed to a decrease of 11.1 per cent in the number of international visitor arrivals over the same period mainly due to adverse negative travel advisories by key source markets.\nThe World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate report, says the tourism sector remains one of the world's largest and fastest-growing economic sectors, responsible for nine per cent of gross domestic product globally and providing one in 11 jobs.\n\"Tourism is heavily reliant on energy-intensive modes of transport including aeroplanes and automobiles. Currently contributing approximately five per cent of the global total, carbon emissions from tourism are predicted to more than double within 25 years,\" the report says.\nAccording to the report, adaptation capacity in the tourism sector varies and it is likely to be especially hard for communities and operators with large investments.\n\"Investments such as infrastructure such as hotels, resorts, harbours and airports, could become stranded assets, especially in heavily affected coastal areas. For all destinations, disaster preparedness and management will become an increasingly important part of any destination's integrated management plans as climate-related disasters worsen,\" the hard hitting report says, warning least developed countries to adequately prepare as they are more vulnerable to extreme events than richer ones.\nThe report says the heritage sites have the potential to provide some of the best models and innovative examples of sustainable tourism due to their international designation and the resulting resources and attention they receive.\nIt says that the sites remain important to the future generations and as such sustainable and adaptive management strategies should be instituted to help make sites more resilient to climate change.\nThe 108-page report recognises the role that the indigenous and local populations have, saying their unique and valuable local knowledge, traditions and cultural practices that can contribute to effective management strategies in the face of rapid climatic change.\nUnesco's director for world heritage center Mechtild Rossler says there is need to better understand, monitor and address climate change threats to World Heritage sites.\n\"As the report's findings underscore, achieving the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to a level well below 2 degrees celsius is vitally important to protecting our World Heritage for current and future generations,\" she says.\nLead author of the report and deputy director of the Climate and Energy Programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists Adam Markham, said climate change is affecting World Heritage sites across the globe.\n\"World governments, the private sector and tourists all need to coordinate their efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to protect the world's most treasured cultural and natural resources from the impact of tourism activities,\" Elisa Tonda, Unep's head of the Responsible Industry and Value Chains Unit, says.\n\"Policies to decouple tourism from natural resource impacts, carbon emissions and environmental harm will engage a responsible private sector and promote change in tourists' behaviour to realise the sectors' potential in some of the world's most visited places,\" she adds.\nBecause World Heritage sites must have \"Outstanding Universal Value,\" the report recommends that the World Heritage Committee consider the risk of prospective sites become degraded by climate change before they add them to the list.",

        "text": "Climate change can be expected to boost the number of annual premature US deaths from heat waves in coming decades and to increase mental health problems from extreme weather like hurricanes and floods, a US study said on Monday.\n\"I don't know that we've seen something like this before, where we have a force that has such a multitude of effects,\" Surgeon General Vivek Murthy told reporters at the White House about the study.\n\"There's not one single source that we can target with climate change, there are multiple paths that we have to address.\"\nHeat waves were estimated to cause 670 to 1,300 US deaths annually in recent years. Premature US deaths from heat waves can be expected to rise more than 27,000 per year by 2100, from a 1990 baseline, one scenario in the study said. The rise outpaced projected decreases in deaths from extreme cold.\nExtreme heat can cause more forest fires and increase pollen counts and the resulting poor air quality threatens people with asthma and other lung conditions.\nThe report said poor air quality will likely lead to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths, hospital visits, and acute respiratory illness each year by 2030.\nClimate change also threatens mental health, the study found. Post traumatic stress disorder, depression, and general anxiety can all result in places that suffer extreme weather linked to climate change, such as hurricanes and floods. More study needs to be done on assessing the risks to mental health, it said.\nCases of mosquito and tick-borne diseases can also be expected to increase, though the study, completed over three years, did not look at whether locally-transmitted Zika virus cases would be more likely to hit the United States.\nPresident Barack Obama's administration has taken steps to cut carbon emissions by speeding a switch from coal and oil to cleaner energy sources.\nIn February, the Supreme Court dealt a blow to the White House's climate ambitions by putting a hold Obama's plan to cut emissions from power plants. Administration officials say the plan is on safe legal footing.\nJohn Holdren, Obama's senior science adviser, said steps the world agreed to in Paris last year to curb emissions through 2030 can help fight the risks to health.\n\"We will need a big encore after 2030 ... in order to avoid the bulk of the worst impacts described in this report,\" he said.",

        "text": "Last week was intense. The atmosphere of hope over COP21 meetings in Paris, a couple of days in Mombasa working with a supremely creative local performance group on our Young Cities initiative, and then a former British colony celebrated 52 years since independence.\nMany Kenyans celebrated Kenya@52. And how I wish we could all truly love our country, denounce greed and corruption and jettison narrow ethnic calculus. This country can be great but such greatness must be built on the shoulders of selfless individuals who ask not what they can reap, but what they must sow.\nEnergy is at the heart of the global climate crisis. What is needed is a robust and binding commitment by all countries to shift from the use of oil, coal and gas, which supplies 80 per cent of global energy needs, to the use of renewable sources such as solar, wind, geothermal and hydro.\nHowever, such a transition would require huge breakthroughs in technology and major investments in infrastructure. Moreover, the expectation of developing countries is that developed countries pay for their energy transition through direct spending or through inexpensive transfer of technology.\nCOP21 started on a promising note. The United States and 19 other countries pledged to double their spending over five years to support clean energy research. Led by Bill Gates, 28 private investors, including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, pledged money to help build private businesses based on publicly funded clean energy research.\nThe promising, cooperative start of COP21was short lived. It was depressing to see hubris and ego of nations on display in the final days of the COP21 meeting in Paris. China led the so-called developing world in pressing for the continuation of the current two-tier system where obligations to cut back carbon emissions or a shift to clean energy must be shouldered by the so-called developed countries.\nOn December 12, after 13 days of negotiations, diplomats issued a final draft of a climate change agreement in Paris. If adopted, the agreement would set an ambitious goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.\nHowever, the agreement does not mandate how much each country must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. But it establishes a bottom-up system in which each country sets its own goal, \"intended nationally determined contributions\", and communicates plans to achieve that objective. While it is commendable that many countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania, actually submitted their INDC before COP21, greater emissions reduction pledges will be required to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\nI think Article 4 paragraph 1 of the Paris Agreement is pretty tepid in mandating an end date to greenhouse emissions for developing countries, which include the world's foremost polluters such as China and India. The agreement requires that: \"Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognising that peaking will take longer for developing country Parties.\" Such wording waters down, significantly, the stated goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming. Moreover, it is hard to see how the requirement to update pledges made in nationally determined contributions every five years after 2020 will be enforced.\nThe scientific community is sceptical about how the Paris Agreement will achieve the goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels. Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research based in Britain believes that the Paris Agreement is not consistent with the science and is between dangerous and deadly for the most vulnerable nations of the world. Former NASA scientist James Hansen has described the agreement as a fraud.\nIt is shameful that world leaders have shown no interest in making hard choices to de-carbonise the global economy. The Paris Agreement was the easy thing to do because a legally binding agreement would encounter international resistance from developing countries. Moreover a binding agreement would face stiff domestic political challenges in the United States.\nParis was a missed opportunity. The narrow imperatives of economic growth triumphed. As Naomi Klein said, the climate change movement has yet to find its moral voice on the world stage.\nDr Awiti is the director of the East African Institute at Aga Khan University.",

        "text": "It was an agreement born from a fear of failure, delivered by the smoothness of French diplomacy.\nSix years earlier, countries had bitterly walked away from global climate talks in Copenhagen without a deal.\nThe decision to reassemble in Paris to try again at getting almost 200 countries to sign a pact on cutting carbon emissions was a gamble: another collapse could end world's ability to forge a common approach to dealing with climate change.\nAnd no political leader wanted his reputation stained by a repeat of the debacle in Copenhagen.\nSo there was no detail of hospitality too small for the French hosts this time, no country negotiator who would go unflattered by Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who presided over the conference.\nFabius had been the youngest French prime minister in history in the 1980s; now he was an elder statesman looking to carve a bigger place in it.\nOver two weeks under the global spotlight, his sonorous voice and relentless optimism would come to define the public tone of the proceedings. But behind the scenes, the talks witnessed the confrontations and five-past-midnight compromises to be expected when sleep-deprived negotiators from almost every country in the world are supposed to come to a consensus.\nThey ultimately found it, remarkably only one day later than planned. But the path to the standing ovations at the end was strewn with disputes over money, the emergence of an effective new climate coalition of states, and hours of wrangling over what \"should\" or \"shall\" be done.\nFRENCH WAYS\nFor the survivors of Copenhagen, the key to success in Paris would be preparation.\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon complained that the political leaders had not been well-prepared for the Copenhagen meeting, and this time he and the French conducted extensive advance work to get other leaders personally engaged.\nThey also decided that, if leaders were to come to Paris, they would do so at the beginning to lend the talks some political oxygen, rather than arriving for a scramble at the end.\nSo on Nov. 30, the sprawling conference hall near the Le Bourget airfield on the outskirts of Paris hosted world leaders, who were supposed to deliver three minutes of encouragement.\nFabius wandered the conference center before they arrived, tapping microphones and checking the video monitors under a podium made of recycled wood. \"Ah, we have Prince Charles,\" he said to an aide, consulting the speakers' list.\nThe opening day speeches were seen as a success. UN officials were relieved at the relatively cooperative tone from Russian President Vladimir Putin who was among several leaders who assured Ban privately before the outset that Russia would not block a deal, UN officials said later.\nFabius pulled together a team of officials and diplomats from across the French civil service to facilitate the talks. \"He treated it less like a climate negotiation and more like a trade deal,\" said one UN veteran of past climate talks.\nHe also constantly praised delegates for their hard work and insights, before telling them exactly what schedule of debate they had to follow to finish by their self-imposed deadline of Friday, Dec. 11.\nHe gave the job of writing the accord's preamble to Venezuela's minister Claudia Salerno, whose country had been perhaps the harshest critic of the Copenhagen process that was seen as a collusion of big powers dictating to small countries, making her personally vested in finding compromises.\nNot all developing countries were easily won over, however, a central sticking point throughout the talks was the degree to which the agreement would be legally binding on countries, especially the rich ones who are expected to provide the hundreds of billions of dollars in funding to cover the transition to a low carbon future.\nThe differences were expressed in wrangles over wording. Hard, legally binding commitments were proceeded in the text as items that countries \"shall\" do. Those items that were simply good intentions fell into the \"should\" do category.\nHALF A DEGREE CLOSER\nFacing unbudging demands to put their financial commitments into legal language, U.S. negotiators knew they had to break the poor vs. rich country divide.\nTheir tactic was to sign up to a loose coalition of countries called the High Ambition Coalition.\nThe European Union takes credit for starting the group as far back as 2011, when it was a loose alliance between the EU and small island states.\nAs Paris approached, it expanded to include African, Caribbean and Pacific nations, developing an agenda that included the goal of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century.\nThe number had almost been banished from serious discussion ahead of Paris. But the American decision to \"join\" the High Ambition Coalition brought the 1.5 goal back into play, sweetened with pledges of hundreds of millions of dollars to help island and developing states mitigate the ill-effects of climate change.\nAlthough the promise is only aspirational, the re-emergence of references to 1.5 degrees in the Paris text brought several influential developing countries into the U.S. camp.\nSoon Canada joined, then Australia and Brazil, a collection of wealthy, heavy-polluting western countries marching into the plenary hall alongside the Marshall Islands. China's negotiators dismissed the High Ambition Coalition as a stunt. \"This is a kind of performance by some members,\" said Liu Zhenmin, deputy head of the China delegation. But the solidarity of the developing nation bloc was broken.\nLAST BRIDGES AND HICCUPS\nClimate change summits have developed a particular theater of their own. In one moment, it was possible to see actor Alec Baldwin expressing his fears for the planet to journalists, across from an Indonesian pavilion hosting a party to show off its pilot green energy hospitals.\nBut much of the real work was done by people not even at Le Bourget.\nAfter visiting at the start, U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed roadblocks by telephone, and the two countries appeared to be mostly on the same page.\nOther housekeeping of the text was taken care of. Negotiators insured that a specific reference to climate effects on \"occupied territories\" was taken out to keep the politics focused on climate issues.\nBy Saturday, Fabius the pieces were falling into place. \"I think we're done here,\" said a happy Marshall Islands foreign minister Tony de Brum on Saturday morning. There was to be one last hiccup.\nThe final text had settled on 143 items prefaced by \"shall,\" 40 with \"should.\" But in one section, the words appeared to have been flipped. Suddenly, there was a delay in the hall where delegates had convened amid smiles and air kisses to seal the deal.\nFabius and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry left the room, replaced by rumors of trouble. But then the French minister was back. A technical glitch, he explained, brought on by the fatigue of a drafter.\nThe organizers announced corrections to a few typographical errors, and tellingly switched one last \"should\" for a \"shall\" before Fabius swiftly brought the gavel down.",

        "text": "African countries are participating in the 21st Conference of parties (COP21) in Paris at the background of the scientific findings that the continent is the least greenhouse gas emitter but the most vulnerable to effects of climate change.\nAs the world leaders meet in Paris with an aim to reduce the global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius before the 1950's, scientists have warned that 2 degrees will expose the African continent to 4degrees warmer temperatures.\nA situation the World Bank warns will lead to drought and floods devastating agriculture and economies in Africa \"by 2030 extreme heat and droughts will leave 40% of the land currently used in growing maize incapable of growing maize and will also destroy the savannah grasslands supporting livestock farming\" warned World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim.\nDr Elija Gichuru, the Coffee Research Institute director, says rising temperatures and erratic rainfall is threatening sustainable coffee production by enabling outbreak of Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) and Coffee Leaf Rust diseases that decrease the quality and yield of coffee berries.\n\"Coffee berry disease affects young berries between one to three months and can cause 50-80 percent loss on average; while the Coffee leaf rust disease defoliates the plants making it loose leaves. This leads to lack of food for the plant and eventually poor quality coffee and yield\" notes Gichuru\nThis Gichuru says is affecting the economies of nearly a million small holder coffee farmers in Kenya where coffee is ranked third in Kenya's foreign exchange earnings.\nIn 2011-2012 drought in East Africa affected over 13 million people in the region. Pasture and water scarcity due to recurrent drought in northern region continue to be a key driving force for conflict between communities in the porous borders as livestock and people move around.\nEvans Kituyi a Senior Programme Specialist on Climate Change at the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) notes that, the continent's backbone sectors, such as agriculture, energy, tourism, and healthcare, are highly climate sensitive and dependent on healthy ecosystems.\n\"COP21 provides a platform on which most of these issues will be debated and decisions for action negotiated and embedded in binding agreement \"notes Kituyi\nHe adds that climate change posses uncertain but potentially more risks which include breakdown in food systems, violent conflict associated with resource scarcity and population movement, and exacerbation of poverty, undermining the health and other objectives of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda.\nHow is Africa adapting to Climate Change on its own?\nDespite contributing only 4% of the global emissions, African countries through their Internally National Determined Contributions (INDC's) have committed to reducing their emissions.\n\"Despite the fact that Kenya contributes a mere 0.1% of the total global emissions, we have pledged to voluntarily take national measures and actions for emission reduction and for enhancing adaptation to climate change,\" noted the Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta during his head of state speech at the opening of the conference.\nKenya has committed to reduce her carbon emissions by 30 percent, with Ethiopia committing by 64% while Uganda's commits to cut emissions by 22% and Tanzania to a 10-20% cut by 2030.\nAccording to the United Nation Development Program (UNDP), it is estimated that the cost of Africa's adaptation to climate change will be between $10-30 billion a year by 2030.\nSince Copenhagen in 2009 developed countries pledged to give USD100 Bilion a year by 2020 and promised to provide USD30 Billion in what they called \"fast start finance\" period of 2010-2012.\nAccording to George Wamukoya a technical adviser to the African Group of Negotiators despite the pledges there are no mechanisms to hold the countries accountable to their commitments.\n\"By 2012 Africa had received USD 132 million only for adaptation and there is no clear path to ramp up support for the USD100 billion pledged by 2020 as pledges are voluntary\" he notes\nKituyi says Africa needs to sustain pressure at the negotiations on the developing countries to honour their commitments. But he also calls on the African countries to raise more funds locally from their national budgets and invest in climate solutions.\n\"This article was produced in the framework of the Media21 Africa Project by CFI, the French operator in media cooperation\"",

Francis, who visited Kenya, Uganda and the Central African Republic, also said the continent was \"a martyr of exploitation\" by wealthy countries who lust after its natural resources and try to impose Western values instead of concentrating on development.\nThe pope was asked if the U.N. climate summit in Paris would mark a turnaround in the fight against global warming.\n\"I am not sure, but I can say to you 'now or never',\" he said. \"Every year the problems are getting worse. We are at the limits.\nIf I may use a strong word I would say that we are at the limits of suicide.\" He spoke of retreating glaciers in Greenland and low-lying countries at risk from rising sea levels.\n\"I am sure that the (Paris delegates) have goodwill to do something.

        "text": "Industrial projects along Ethiopia's Omo River could dry up Lake Turkana and create a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe exacerbated by climate change, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday.\nTurkana, the world's largest desert lake, lies in Kenya's northwest corner, on the border with Ethiopia, and gets 90 per cent of its water from the Omo River.\nEthiopia is one of Africa's fastest-growing economies and has the potential to generate 45,000 megawatts of hydropower by tapping the rivers that cascade through its highlands.\nIt is pushing to become a top energy exporter and manufacturing hub.\nLarge-scale industrialisation of the Omo, including the Gibe 3 hydroelectric dam, which began power production this month, and a planned 2,000-square-km irrigated sugar plantation downstream, could siphon off water from Turkana and wipe out fish stocks.\n\"Lake Turkana is in danger of disappearing, and the health and livelihood of the indigenous peoples of the region along with it,\" Joseph Amon, health and human rights director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement before releasing a report in Nairobi.\nAddis Ababa rejects the claims, saying its own studies show the dam will regulate the river's flow and stabilise water levels in the flood-prone region.\nHuman Rights Watch called on Kenya to initiate talks with Ethiopia and pass a climate change law that would address the persistent drought and disappearing grazing lands in Turkana.\nIts report comes as world leaders prepare to gather in Paris in December to devise a global strategy on climate change.\n\"The struggles of the Turkana people are an important reminder for governments around the world that human rights should be a central element of the future Paris climate change agreement,\" Amon said.\nAverage temperatures around Lake Turkana, which is home to about 300,000 people, have risen by 2-3 degrees Celsius since 1967 and rainfall has been uneven.\nSemi-arid Turkana is one of Kenya's poorest regions. Most of the population are pastoralists, and Human Rights Watch said reports of livestock deaths and increased fighting over the region's scarce resources had increased.",

        "text": "East Africa's coffee output is expected to rise in the short term, but coffee farming may no longer be viable by the end of the century as a result of rising temperatures and increased risk of disease, a new report says.\nThe report produced by scientists from the Climate Institute says East Africa is particularly at risk of being hit by a devastating outbreak of the Coffee Berry Borer -- a major pest originating in Congo but now spreading to the region as a result of climate change.\nTitled ''A Brewing Storm'' , the report says the pest has already caused crop damage in excess of $500 million annually since 2001.\nIt was previously confined to crops below 1,500 metres above sea level but has spread up the slope, drawn by hotter, wetter conditions in places like Tanzania and Uganda.\nThe report gives the example of Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro coffee belt where the borer is now found 300 metres higher than where it was 100 years ago.\nA warming of 1-2C, the minimum scientists expect for this century \"will see the borer's numbers explode,\" the report says, spreading outwards from the Equator and upwards to higher altitudes.\nWhile most coffee producing countries are expected to lose half of the areas suitable for coffee production by 2050, it may in the short-term favour highlands coffee growing areas of East Africa as well as in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Andes, the report says.\nBut before the century is out, conditions are set to become inhospitable for Arabica coffee in the wild in East Africa - its centre of origin.\nThe report says this is important because a 2012 paper by scientists at Kew's Royal Botanic Gardens looked specifically at wild Arabica coffee, suggesting that climate change could push it to extinction by 2100. In the Congo basin, where Robusta coffee originated, the wild plant may become locally extinct by 2050, the report said.\n\"Neither wild Robusta nor Arabica seem capable of weathering even middle-of-the-range climate change scenarios,\" according to the scientists, adding that wild coffee plants form a storehouse of genetic resources that could prove vital in the development of new, drought and disease-tolerant Arabica varieties at the very time when coffee farmers need them most.\nCoffee is a key global crop and the second most valuable commodity exported by developing countries, whose global market value stood around $19 billion in 2015.\nREAD: Farmers export batch of processed coffee to Europe\nWorldwide, around 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed everyday.\nOver 120 million people in more than 70 countries rely on the coffee value chain for their livelihoods.",

        "text": "Experts have warned that the North Rift region is headed for a major food crisis as leaders in drought-hit regions say the prolonged dry spell should be declared a national disaster.\nMore than 100,000 people in the North Rift are staring at starvation following the onset of the dry spell in many parts in the region.\nAnd according to a report released by the Kenya Food Security Steering Group and Early Warning Systems Network in January, families in Samburu, Marsabit, Isiolo, Garissa, Mandera and Wajir counties faced food scarcity and inadequate pasture and water for their animals.\nIn parts of Baringo, West Pokot and Turkana counties in the North Rift, food shortage is likely to be complicated by the onset of the dry spell.\nThe National Drought Management Authority has called on pastoralists in arid areas of the country to put in place measures to cushion them against losses occasioned by the persistent drought.\n\"Livestock farmers should sell emaciated cows...to avert looming losses. The situation may worsen,\" said the drought agency's Baringo County coordinator Amos Nyakeyo.\nA spot check by the Nation revealed that food prices in major markets in the region have skyrocketed with a 2kg tin of maize being sold at between Sh120 and Sh140 which is not within reach for many residents forcing some to flee to the neighbouring Elgeyo-Marakwet and West Pokot counties to look for food.\nFEARS OF CONFLICT\n\"Pastoralists are beginning to move to areas like Lochakula, Narion and Kulel at the border of Turkana East and East Pokot sparking fears of conflicts for water and pasture,\" Tirioko MCA Stephen Maklap told the Nation.\nWest Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo named parts of Pokot North sub-county where famine stricken families are in urgent need of emergency relief supplies and essential health and nutrition services.\nBut as the families in these counties face starvation, maize farmers in the North Rift are issuing ultimatums to the government to buy the produce.\nStudents and pupils in arid areas have also been hit hard with most deserting schools due to the biting drought.\nAccording to the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, Daniel Karaba, the situation was almost getting out of hand.\n\"The national government should declare the drought a national disaster without delay,\" he told the Nation on Mondayin Kutus Town, Kirinyaga County.\nMr Karaba said a visit to schools in Wajir County, together with his committee last week, revealed that only a handful of learners were attending classes.\nIn Nyeri, Kieni MP Kanini Kega, whose constituency is a semi-arid area, asked the national government to declare the drought a national disaster due to its severity.\nWhile launching a feeding programme in Karichane Primary School in his constituency on Monday, the MP said the number of people affected by the drought was soaring every day.\nLIVESTOCK DIE\n\"We have seen our livestock die and people seriously affected but if the government is able to declare this a national disaster definitely there will be mitigation measures,\" he argued.\nThe lawmaker said more than 100 schools in his constituency had been affected by the drought noting that some families had forced to relocate.\nThe livestock sector is the major economic mainstay especially in the region has also been adversely been affected by the persistent dry spell with major water sources drying up leading to emaciation of livestock.\nThe deteriorating food situation and pasture in the region is likely to fuel armed conflicts among pastoralists.\nAt Nginyang' livestock market in Tiaty sub-county for instance, a cow which used to sell at Sh30,000 in November last year is now going at Sh10,000 while a goat which used to sell at Sh5,000 in the same period now going at a mere Sh2,000.\nResidents have no alternative but to sell their animals at throw away prices for fear that they will perish due to lack of water and pasture.\nLeaders from the affected counties have petitioned the government to provide humanitarian interventions to avert calamities as witnessed in previous dry spell periods.",

The hardest hit areas are Magarini and Ganze sub-counties, with more than 80,000 in Ganze on the verge of starvation.\nCoast Regional Coordinator Nelson Marwa said in Ganze yesterday that the drought had affected several counties in the region. \"We have put forward strategies of food distribution to the affected areas as short term measure to mitigate the effects of the biting drought. We shall mobilise water bowsers to ensure sufficient supply of clean water to the affected areas,\" Mr Marwa said.\nKilifi County Commissioner Joseph Keter said the national government was working in partnership with British and Finland Red Cross societies to mitigate the effects of the drought.\nHe noted that the government will give out Sh28 million, where each household will receive Sh6,000 every month for the next four months.\nHe said another 7, 439 households in the hardest hit areas will be given Sh15 million. On Tuesday, Kenya Red Cross distributed relief food to 3,077 households at the county commission's grounds as well as in Bamba, Ganze, Vitengeni and Jaribuni divisions.\nMr Marwa asked counties to work together with the government to seek a permanent solution to the drought.\nPRIORITISE CALAMITY\nKilifi North MP Gideon Mung'aro accused Governor Amason Kingi of failing to prioritise the calamity. \"The county has misplaced priorities on how they spend funds, they have funded an investment conference which offers no direct solution to the problems the residents are facing,\" he said.\nAnd in Samburu, more than 50, 000 people are facing famine. The World Food Programme will start distributing relief food to affected families on Wednesday.\nSamburu Drought Coordinator Alex Leseketeti said yesterday the county government had purchased 10,000 bags of maize for needy families.\nThe National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) said the number of those affected is likely to have increased from the 54,000 announced 13 days ago.\nNDMA says no deaths have been reported so far. The worst-hit areas are Wamba, Baragoi, Suyan, Sere Olipi, Ntepes and some parts in Samburu North.\nSpeaking to Nation on Tuesday, Mr Leseketeti said NDMA, in collaboration with the county government had started distributing water to the affected areas.\nIn Kitui, more than 26,000 are facing starvation. County Drought Coordinator Francis Koma on Tuesday said Kitui South was worst-hit followed by Kitui East, Mwingi Central, North and West, and Kitui Rural and Central in that order. \"These people are in dire need of food to save them from starvation.\nLivestock is also at risk as most of the animals are already emaciated,\" he said.",

        "text": "The weatherman has warned that the coming months are going to be drier, consequently affecting farming activities.\nAccording to the Meteorological Department, the October, November and December season will be characterised by depressed rainfall driven by la nina conditions.\nThe warning is a call to farmers - who are growing crops or keeping animals - to prepare lest they are caught unawares.\nFor livestock keepers, it cannot be gainsaid that dry spells are a great danger because most farmers depend on the rains to grow fodder.\nA range of measures, however, would come in handy for you to beat the dry weather and emerge unscathed or at least reduce the effect.\nFirst, any obvious cull animals should go as soon as possible. This would give you control of your stock by reducing feed demand to allow for better nutrition of the productive cows.\nGrow more pasture grasses that mature early, give good yield with reasonable nutrients and are highly palatable before the dry spell sets in proper.\nGrasses like Kikuyu, cenchrus species and brachiaria are known to provide high quality fodder during dry seasons and surplus can always be conserved.\nDROUGHT TOLERANT FEED SOURCES\nThough drought is expected, soils normally have retained water capacity just before the onset.\nSo broadcast grasses with nitrogen fertiliser to increase their response for greater dry matter yields. But this should be well-timed.\nSilage making is another beneficial move. This is the time to harvest that high fodder plant like yellow maize for silage making.\nThe more silage you make and store, the better. Drought-tolerant feed sources like sorghum fodder will also turn out to be beneficial for silage making.\n(Read: I make one-year feeds for my cows)\nDuring dry spells, feeds like concentrates and conserved fodder like hay get scarce and become expensive.\nThis means feeding all your animals to their preferred optimum will be expensive, therefore, compromise will be necessary.\nIn readiness for the dry spell, make hay to maintain supply of quality of feeds to your stock.\nHeifers are potentially the best animals in the herd yet low quality forage limits growth rates and lengthens their time to first calving. Hay will, therefore, help you supply them with quality feeds.\nIn-calf cows at this time need closer attention and care. Extra feeds will be required for them and their soon-to-be born offspring.\nWATER MANAGEMENT\nIf not well-taken care of, they may lose body condition and produce less milk after calving down and compromise on reproductive efficiency.\nIrrigation assists the establishment of fodder for continuity of production during dry periods. If resources allow you to irrigate, regularly monitor soil moisture levels to help develop a good working plan.\nDuring dry spells, feeds like concentrates and conserved fodder like hay get scarce and become expensive meaning feeding all your animals to their preferred optimum will be expensive, therefore, compromise will be necessary. FILE PHOTO | NATION MEDIA GROUP\nRemember water will soon be scarce. Therefore, it is advisable to fully water the best part of your farm instead of poorly watering the whole farm.\nKeep heat stress in mind. This occurs when heat load is greater than the animal's capacity to lose it and consequently it alters their production.\nMinimum measures can be employed during these times like providing access to clean drinking water at all times, keep the animals in good sheds, reduce walking distance and speed of the cows during grazing and handle the animals with care.\n(Read also: Use this guide to care for your cows this rainy season)\nWhen preparing for extended dry periods, it is important to understand the importance of water management. Ensure that your stock has enough water as the demand will definitely increase. Existing farm water storage points should also be filled if possible.\nDrought affected stock can consume large quantities of sand and dirt, poisonous plants or excessive amounts of indigestible materials leading to impaction in the gut.\nThis is especially so for open grazing animals. During the dry period, the animals lurk everywhere in search of feeds with rubbish pits especially in the urban and peri-urban areas being a favourite site.\nMonitor the animals as they may consume plastic bags and other unwanted materials leading to death.\nCONTROLLING DISEASES AND PARASITES\nSome poisonous plants like lantana camara during dry spells remain green, therefore, attractive to animals. Farmers should, therefore, be careful on where their animal graze.\nDuring the dry spell, parasites and infectious diseases are common. This is due to increased transmission in crowded conditions around water and feed sources.\nPoor nutrition associated with drought periods also make animals easily succumb to diseases as a result of low immunity.\nFurther, sanitation and hygiene is often compromised during the dry spell due to limited availability of water.\nFarmers, therefore, tend to clean the cowsheds and the animal beddings irregularly, exposing their animals to diseases.\nSome of diseases to watch during the period include Foot and Mouth Disease and East Coast Fever caused by ticks. The parasites and flies can be controlled by spraying.\nThe writer works in the Department of Animal Science, Egerton University and the founder of www.dairycloud.co.ke\n****\nMaking silage",

        "text": "Villagers in Zimbabwe are skipping meals and foraging for wild fruit as food stocks run out after a poor harvest blamed on drought and controversial land reforms.\n\"Even if the children complain of hunger there is nothing we can do about it,\" says Rabian Chidamba, 40, a mother of four who lives in Musana district northwest of the capital Harare.\nTWO MEALS A DAY\nShe has cut the family's meals to two a day as she ekes out her small stock of the staple food, maize.\nBreakfast is tea with home-baked cornmeal bread, while supper is cornmeal and fried kale, occasionally supplemented with a small portion of meat.\n\"When the children get hungry between meals they go and look for wild fruit,\" Chidamba says.\nShe still has some maize in her makeshift granary, unlike many of her compatriots in other districts whose food stores are empty, but the next harvest is not due until April or May next year.\n\"Our harvest came to 10 bags of maize instead of the 30 bags we usually get,\" she said.\nChidamba usually sells surplus maize to raise money for her children's school fees and other necessities, but this year's harvest is not enough even to feed her own family.\nAt least 1.5 million Zimbabweans are in need of food aid, according to the United Nations World Food Programme and other aid agencies.\nOnce a major producer of maize, Zimbabwe has become a perennial importer of food following a slump in agricultural production blamed on President Robert Mugabe's land reforms, which saw the seizure of land from white commercial farmers for redistribution to landless blacks.\nThis year, drought has played a major role in reducing harvests in many southern African countries, with Malawi, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana among the worst-hit.\nAn estimated 27.4 million people out of the region's combined population of 292 million - or nearly one in 10 people - will be depending on food handouts by the end of the year.\nDESPERATE VILLAGERS\nWorld Food Programme spokesman David Orr told AFP Zimbabwe and Malawi were facing their \"worst food security crisis\" in a decade.\nMugabe says the low yields are due to erratic rains caused by climate change, along with a lack of fertilizer, seed and farming equipment for the beneficiaries of his land reforms, most of whom lacked the means to run farms.\nTo alleviate hunger this year, the government has relaxed import regulations to allow individuals and private companies to import grain to supplement local supplies.\nFOOD AID APPEAL\nSo far imports consist of maize grain from Zambia and maize meal from South Africa, according to the agriculture ministry.\nVice President Emmerson Mnangagwa has appealed for cash from \"development agencies and the private sector\" to ensure that the vulnerable are not \"exposed to hunger and starvation\".\nHowever, the USAid-funded Famine Early Warning System Network has warned that \"the lean season humanitarian assistance is expected to be lower than average due to a challenging funding situation\".\nWFP said it will start distributing food at the end of September to recipients who will work on projects including building small dams, repairing roads and starting vegetable gardens.\nPOOR HARVESTS\n\"Because of the poor harvest this year, food security levels are deteriorating earlier during the lean season than usual,\" said WFP information officer Tinashe Mubaira.\n\"Consumption coping strategies at the moment are reduction of portion sizes and eating fewer meals. Communities in districts bordering neighbouring countries are crossing over to Mozambique and Zambia for casual labour,\" he said.\nZvidzai Nyakudirwa, a storekeeper in Chinamhora communal lands, said desperate villagers were bartering their livestock for maize, often getting a bad deal.\nThey were also selling their livestock \"at very low prices\", he said.\n\"It's tough for many families here,\" said Nyakudirwa, noting that most of his customers were now travellers passing through, rather than the villagers themselves.\nDROUGHT\nAmong the worst affected areas are the southern province of Matabeleland North, Masvingo and Matabeleland South, according to government figures.\nSouth Africa, the regional breadbasket, has also been hard hit by drought, recording a 31 percent decline in output this year.",

        "text": "Earlier this in the month, I called a senior official at the Kenya Meteorological Department concerning the rains.\nThere had just been a heavy downpour the previous night and I wanted to know whether the intensity of the tempest was greater than usual.\nThe man, who is in the forecasting department, assured me that the levels of rain experienced were normal. He then quoted several data sets that bamboozled me and told me to ignore the frightful pictures I had seen on social media.\nThen it came to the time for him to earn his money and forecast the weather. Nairobi, I was informed, will experience normal rainfall levels for the entire long rains period, so there was nothing to worry about.\nI asked the same question thrice, more because I was sceptical of his dismissive note than anything else, and was given the same answer: Rain? Nothing to worry about.\nEventually, I bowed a knee to his years of expertise and wrote a news story saying that the rain would be adequate, and that there was nothing to worry about.\nRelated Content THE WAG: What we need are more doctors, not video links\nPASSING CLOUD OR BREWING STORM\n\"Passing cloud\" isn't news. \"A storm is brewing\" is what arrests attention, and so the story I did rightly got relegated to the county pages.\nIt has taken less than a fortnight to put paid to that forecast. A storm was coming and the forecasting department did not alert us in time.\nPerhaps now isn't a good time to remind people that, in October 2014, the mets warned that millions of Kenyans would be facing hunger in six months due to drought. Instead, Kenyans are dying of cholera and being swept away by the rains.\nNairobi experienced a massive increase in rainfall this past week that overwhelmed the water drainage system and laid bare its water management inadequacies. This recent disaster meshed well with the message of the book I was reading called The Resilience Dividend, by Judith Rodin.\nThe writer defines resilience as the capacity of any entity - corporation or society - to prepare for sudden unpredictable disruptions to their activity; their ability to recover from them and then to take advantage of new lessons and opportunities produced by the disruption for further growth and expansion.\nMost of the examples in her book deal with global cities and their governance, and the book tackles the three great problems of the 21st century - globalisation, climate change and urbanisation.\nMs Rodin is the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, which runs the 100 Resilient Cities initiative from which she draws a number of the examples she cites.\nHer message on tackling urbanisation is particularly important when it comes to our cities. The climatic disruptions that our city officials will have to deal with will be longer in length and severity. The world is becoming more densely populated and urban, the numbers concentrated on coastlines and near major rivers.\nIn Kenya, the two main cities will have to grapple with freshwater scarcity, and increased storm frequency and intensity.\nMombasa, in particular, faces deteriorating water quality and availability. Also, the effects of global warming and glacial melt mean that Mombasa's future as a coastal city is a matter of great concern.\nPERMEABLE PAVEMENTS\nThe situation in Nairobi is particularly fluid and ongoing, requiring constant checks due to an increase in peri-urban settlements.\nOn Tuesday we were flooded with pictures of houses filled with black water (rain mixed with sewage).\nWe saw buildings being swept away, walls collapsing and residents resorting to kayaking to move around.\nRodin's book serves as a template for thinking about the crises facing cities and would help Nairobi's chief executive with examples of how to deal with the problems bedeviling it.\nThe Resilience Dividend has numerous examples of how societies across four continents have dealt with disruptions such as floods.\nIn San Francisco, US, after a freak storm described as a once-in-a-century affair, engineers discovered that, just as in Nairobi, the drainage had been designed to handle huge quantities of water, but the increased volume from the storm, coupled with collected debris clogging the drains, had led to massive flooding.\nThe city began organising annual drain clearances before the rainy season. In Kenya, we note that the NYS only got on the job after the fact of the deluge.\nThe Netherlands is the world leader in flood prevention for the obvious reason that most of the country is below sea level.\nSome towns have non-conventional ideas like permeable pavements that help in water drainage; while others have created large flat barriers called berms that accumulate water in order to ease the burden on the drainage system.\nThe book also puts in a good word about using insurance to protect against flooding. The state should ensure that all buildings above a certain value are insured to encourage thinking about flood and earthquake risks. If the cities' prevention strategies are good the premiums will be low, and vice versa.\nThere is a challenge that may come with that, though. This will deflate the property bubble as the presence of an added cost of a premium and a mandatory risk assessment to a house will lead to its value going down.\nHowever, a deflationary effect is better if we all end up being safer from floods.\nI strongly recommend the book to Dr Evans Kidero and offer Mombasa governor Ali Hassan Joho my copy of the book. Joho will need it more because he faces greater challenges than the Nairobi governor.\n********\nNEW TECHNOLOGY\nScience can help us better our species, all we need to do is trust it\nIn April, Chinese scientists reported that they had edited genomes of human embryos with the aim of improving them.\nThey had tried to get rid of a fatal blood disorder from a non-viable embryo and, understandably, several bodies raised concern about this development.\nThe reason this study scared so many people was that those changes, called germline modifications, are inherited.\nIf you get it wrong, you could be dooming a future generation.\nIn the past decade DNA sequencing has become cheaper, meaning we now know more about the various forks in the evolutionary road that we took to get here.\nScientists are working harder towards achieving the aphorism of \"know thyself\", and today we know more about migration and changes - not just of ourselves, but of the animals that have sustained us - and diseases that have plagued us for millions of years.\nThere has never been a better generation of scientists primed to experiment with human DNA.\nThere is really no point worrying about scientists playing god, because someone has to.\nWe are still imperfect products of a random system and, as such, our bodies are littered with errors. Mother Nature has been hard at work for four billion years, grafting animal DNA.\nWe have helped her when with the plants and we are helping her regarding livestock; it is time we helped her with what is arguably her greatest creation.\nOur bodies are a universe of cells, some of which self-sabotage while others go rogue, and errors at a basic level could kill trillions of other cells. Constant improvement of the stock of human potential is a duty that every generation should aspire to.\nDisease has been our enemy for too long, death's sting too heavy a burden.\nMathematically, due to all the possible ways of combining genetic information, there must be other ways of putting together better humans than the ones that exist. Shouldn't we at least consider the possibility?\nThere are risks, but there are also possibilities. Let us concentrate on the possibilities.\nFEEDBACK: On whether we need more doctors or video links in hospitals\nLINKS ARE USEFUL:\nWaga, I believe the main purpose of the video link between Kenyatta National Hospital and Machakos is sharing and exchanging information among colleagues.\nI will cite two examples: (i) if an X-ray examination is done in Machakos by a technician but there is no radiologist to study it, it can be transmitted in real-time to KNH and save the patient a trip to Nairobi, and (ii) a breast biopsy with inconclusive diagnosis on nature or type of cancer can be projected from a microscope in Machakos and read by another doctor in Nairobi, India, or anywhere else.\nI suggest that you visit the Lancet lab or Aga Khan Hospital's radiology department as these have satellite stations in various parts of the country and East Africa.\nAlso, at University of Nairobi's Chiromo campus, where First Year medical students are inducted into medicine, this technology has been in use for a couple of years.\nAt Chiromo, surgical operations and cardiac procedures can be transmitted in real-time to an audience in a remote site as a learning process.\nJane W Karioki\nGOOD JOB:\nWaga, l greatly and highly congratulate you for your columns because of the great concern and deep wisdom in them.\nThey have greatly inspired and motivated me.\nThank you, and keep up with the good work!\nMuriithi Duncan\n*********\nMISPLACED PRIORITIES:\nWaga, I just want to let you know that I am in full agreement with your article about doctors.\nI am a doctor who trained abroad and did some medical tourism in our local hospitals.\nThe state of the wards and lack of personnel and basic equipment such as electrocardiogram machines in cardiology wards is immoral.\nDon't even get me started on the low amount of blood in blood banks, or the inane administrative rules about how many theatres remain open and are available over the weekends for emergency surgeries!\nI have witnessed many deaths of patients who came in walking but passed on a couple of hours later due to the unavailability of theatre space. This saddens me and I pray for our people.\nThank you for sympathising with our plight and highlighting the folly of misplaced priorities.\nDr S K Maina",

        "text": "For a long time the vast majority of Machakos County residents have toiled on their small family farms under the blistering heat of the unforgiving semi-arid terrain and persistent drought brought by failure of rain.\nYear after year the people have literally begged for water from the government to improve their farming through irrigation.\nFor the majority, water for irrigation remains a pipedream except for a lucky two villages tucked deep in Yatta Sub-County.\nBut life has dramatically changed for people in these two villages of Iviani and Kondo, since a local pastor teamed up with an engineer from the National Irrigation Board (NIB) and wrote a proposal to revive an old water-drinking project that collapsed 15 years ago after running for only four years.\nIt was a simple yet noble wish to change the community that inspired Reverend Stephen Kioko, the YMCA Kondo Branch Manager, to dream up the rehabilitation of the collapsed old water project into an irrigation scheme.\nThrough collaboration with the Yatta District Irrigation Officer Patrick Njiru, the irrigation board released Sh24 million to fund two hundred farmers to irrigate a quarter acre each through the drip irrigation system.\nFarmers use drip pipes to irrigate the crops. PHOTO | WYCLIFFE MUIA | NATION MEDIA GROUP\nSUPPLIED FARMERS WITH DRIP LINES\nThe NIB, through a contractor, supplied the farmers with drip lines, pesticides and fertilizer, but only 96 households out of the 200 farmers were able to receive the drip lines.\nA new electricity water pump was installed at the pump house located near Yatta canal and the sump tank rehabilitated.\nThe locals have now taken up commercial farming, albeit reluctantly, and are growing tomatoes, water melons, sukuma wiki, cabbages, onions, French beans and traditional vegetables among many other crops.\nPatrick Kimeu, one of the beneficiaries of the irrigation scheme, was among the first people to take up commercial farming after the irrigation board installed drip lines in his farm.\n\"I planted tomatoes in an eighth of an acre farm after realising that a quarter acre farm was too big to manage and I harvested 12 crates which brought a profit of Sh24,000,\" said Patrick.\nFarmers in Iviani and Kondo villages in Yatta can now plant various crops without having to wait for the rains. PHOTO | WYCLIFFE MUIA | NATION MEDIA GROUP\nPLANTED WATER MELONS\nImmediately after harvesting the tomatoes, Patrick planted water melons seeds that he was given for demonstration by the irrigation board on another eight acre patch and is expecting to rake in at least Sh30,000 in less than a month when they mature.\nWater melons take about 90 days to mature. On the eighth acre patch he harvested the tomatoes, Patrick is now planning to plant cabbages.\n\"I have been able to pay school fees for my two children in high school with no balance left. I have also employed one worker to help in the farm,\" Patrick added gleefully.\nIn addition, Patrick has planted sukuma wikis which he harvests every two weeks as well bananas and pawpaw.\nAnother farmer, 62-year-old Josephine Bahati, planted tomatoes and made Sh12,000 from her first harvest in an eighth of an acre farm.\nAs she continues to harvest the tomatoes, Josephine has also ventured into planting water melons.\n\"These days when I sell my tomatoes I am able to buy soap, sugar and other items required at home. I no longer have to ask for money from any one.\nI can go to the market and make up to Sh2000 in a day's sale,\" said Josephine.\n\"I am also able to buy soft foods for my aging mother and take good care of her,\" added Josephine.\nWater from the Yatta canal is collected in a sump tank and then pumped into an elevated tank before it is piped to farmers. PHOTO | WYCLIFFE MUIA | NATION MEDIA GROUP\nWATER FROM YATTA CANAL\nThe irrigation scheme relies on water from the Yatta canal which is collected in a sump tank and then pumped into an elevated tank with a capacity of 100,000 litres.\nThe water from the elevated tank is then managed through three water lines serving the two villages.\n\"About 36 farmers of the 96 who received the drip irrigation lines from the National Irrigation Board have taken up farming,\" said Stephen.\nHowever, ignorance, illiteracy, apathy and technical problems have been the main obstacles hindering most of the villagers from embarking in commercial farming.\n\"Some people are just using the water for washing clothes, cooking or drinking and are yet to start farming but we are looking forward to building capacity,\" said Rev Kioko, the pioneer of the irrigation project.\nThe pioneers hope that the improved lifestyles and success of those who have taken up irrigation farming will inspire the others, especially the indifferent youth.\nOne of the beneficiaries of the Yatta irrigation project with her tomatoes ready for sale. PHOTO | WYCLIFFE MUIA | NATION MEDIA GROUP\nYOUTH NOT INTERESTED\nFrom the sample of farmers Nation.co.ke met at the village farms, it was clear the youth have ignored the potential benefits they could gain by engaging in commercial farming.\nMost of the farmers are middle-aged men and women.\n\"The youth stay away from our YMCA meetings and refuse to be involved since we do not hand out money,\" explained Rev Kioko.\nThe fresh produce from the farms is mostly sold at the busy Kithimani Town bus stop which is strategically located at the Machakos-Nairobi-Garissa intersection.\nSome of the farmers also sell fresh produce at their farms to neighbours.",

Authorities report that wildlife is straying out of its habitat to attack people and domestic animals and destroy crops in human settlements.\nIn Kwale County, the worst affected areas are Kinango and Samburu, semi arid areas on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway.\nOn Thursday, Lamu Governor Issa Timamy announced a Sh50 million famine and drought emergency fund to stem starvation in parts of the county where man and beast are fighting for scarce water and food.\nHe said the most affected areas are Mkunumbi and Hongwe, which have not had rainfall for many months, hurting farming and pastoralism.\nOther areas are Pandanguo, Witu, Koreni and Basuba and Timamy said the dry conditions are stretching into Ijara and Garissa in North Eastern Region.\nOn the same day, the Kenya Wildlife Service announced that drought had dispersed wildlife from their traditional habitats in search of pasture and water in many parts of Kenya, including Kilifi, Meru, Narok and Tsavo. This has increased the risk of human-wildlife conflict.\nAttacks on people\nThe KWS said there has been an increase in reported incidents of conflicts compared to past years, notable ones being attacks on people, property destruction, preying on livestock and crop raiding.\n\"Cases in point include recent sightings of elephants moving from the Tsavo conservation area to Mwingi Sub-county, while others were reported in Meru, Kilifi and Narok,\" the wildlife agency said in a report.\nThe National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) said due to rainfall failure for most of 2016, more than 72,000 people in Taita Taveta County are facing starvation and urgently need relief supplies.\nThe report says the lowland areas are most affected in terms of lack of pasture and water, dwindling household food stocks, human-wildlife conflicts and increase in commodity prices.",

        "text": "Doctors perform surgery at a hospital. A study has revealed that at least one third of hospitals in developing world lack clean running water.\nAt least a third of hospitals in developing nations do not have clean running water, a study has found, leading to unsanitary conditions and further spread of disease in drought-hit areas.\nThe study examined 430 hospitals in developing countries and found that one third of clinics did not have a reliable source of clean water to perform surgical operations.\nWater availability ranged from 20 per cent in Sierra Leone and Liberia to more than 90 percent in India, Malaysia and Guinea, according to the report, which used World Bank data and analysed previous studies between 2009 and 2015.\n\"Running water is something we take for granted and it doesn't exist in a third of hospitals in these countries,\" said Adam Kushner, lead author of the study, published in the Journal of Surgical Research.\n\"Instead of water just being there, some hospitals truck in water or collect it in rain barrels, with no guarantee of its cleanliness,\" said Kushner, an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University who is also a surgeon.\nEvery year, half a million babies die before they are one-month-old due to a lack of clean water and safe sanitation in hospitals, according to a 2015 report by sanitation charity WaterAid and the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nFor one in five of those babies, being washed in clean water and cared for in a clean and safe environment by people who had washed their hands with soap could have prevented their deaths.\n\"What do you do if a woman shows up in obstructed labour and needs an emergency caesarean section and it's the dry season and the rain barrel is empty?\" Kushner said.\n\"You can't operate with dirty instruments, but if you don't she's going to die. This is the sort of dilemma that surgeons in these hospitals face.\"\nAs climate change contributes to rising sea levels and extreme weather, the United Nations estimates that by 2050 at least one in four people will live in a country with chronic or recurring shortages of fresh water.\nThe unpredictability of climate change could add to challenges in providing safe and hygienic medical care in developing nations, particularly during drought, Kushner said.\n\"Many of the facilities without a continuous supply of water are often dependent on collecting rain water during the rainy season,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.",

        "text": "A maize research body has launched a project to curb devastating effects of the environment on crop production in Sub-Saharan Africa. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement centre (CIMMYT) and its partners will develop new and improved maize varieties and hybrids with resistance and tolerance to drought, low soil fertility, diseases such as Maize Lethal Necrosis and pests. The project is known as Stress Tolerant Maize for Africa (STMA).\n\"STMA will use modern breeding technologies that will confer the desired resistance to pests and diseases and tolerance to climatic stresses like drought and heat to benefit farmers within their socio-economic capabilities, that often dictate their access to important farm inputs like fertilisers and improved seed,\" said Tsedeke Abate, Project Leader of STMA.\nThe project is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development.\nThe four-year project will put improved maize varieties in the hands of nearly five and a half million smallholder households by end of 2019. The project will also ensure women participation across the maize value chain from production to retail.\nOver 35 million hectares of cultivated maize in SSA is rainfed. Climate change is heightening the intensity and frequency of drought in farmers' fields. At the same time, maize productivity is further reduced by low fertility soils prevalent in most parts of Africa, yet the majority of smallholder farmers cannot afford the recommended amounts of nitrogen fertilisers.\nThese, in addition to other stresses increase the risk of crop failure that negatively affects income, food security and nourishment of millions of smallholder farmers and their families. STMA will draw from successes of the Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa and Improved Maize for African Soils projects, which successfully developed and deployed over 250 improved drought-tolerant and nitrogen-use efficient maize varieties.",

        "text": "A potato farmer sorts his harvest.\nWhat is more devastating for a farmer than a drought that strikes at a time crops are just beginning to bloom? Pretty nothing else.\nFor Dorcas Nyawira, a 32-year-old mother of one, watching her two-acre plantation of maize dry away was gut-wrenching. The rains failed in Nyeri during the last maize-planting season, spelling doom for many farmers who hoped for a bountiful harvest.\nBut just as she was contemplating her loss, Nyawira received a call. The caller informed her that they had reimbursed the money she had used to buy the maize seed and had remitted it to her M-Pesa account.\n\"I could not believe it. I was so shocked. But when I checked my M-Pesa, I found that they had indeed refunded the money,\" she says. \"I do not even know how they found out that my maize crop had failed because I did not tell them. They just knew.\"\nThat call came from the Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise Ltd (Acre Africa). The organisation helps farmers insure their farm products.\nNyawira had just benefited from one of their products referred to as Replanting Guarantee.\n\"When a farmer buys certified seeds insured by Acre Africa, they find a card inside the bag of seeds. This card is tracked and sends back information on the location of the farm to our systems when the bag of seeds is opened,\" says Dr Wilson Songa, a senior advisor in Strategy and Partnerships at the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture.\nSyngenta has partnered with Acre Africa on this initiative.\nAdverse weather\n\"Once the farmer finds the card inside, he or she has the choice to register for insurance of the crop or not. If the farmer chooses not to register, the tracking ends there. But if they do, we monitor the weather to determine how the crop is doing from planting to the harvesting stage,\" he says.\nIf the crop is affected by adverse weather such as drought, storms, flood and erratic rains and other production risks, the company reimburses the farmer through mobile money transfer to enable them buy more seed.\nThe farmer can also receive a discount on their next seed purchase.",

Scarcity of forage and water wiped out Ali Kula's stock of 50 cattle and around 100 goats.\n\"It was painful to see my cattle and goats die in the field for lack of grass,\" he said. The government bought his few remaining cattle for 2,000 shillings ($20) each.\nBy the time he received a payout for his two insured cows, it was too late. He couldn't save his cattle, and his family ended up depending on food aid.\nBut the next time the rains fail, things will be different for Kula, now queuing at noon with his 10 cattle and 30 goats for water from the solar-powered borehole.\nUnlike in the past, when he didn't know what he would do if drought hit, the 38-year-old is confident at least some of his livestock would survive.\nThat is because he has spent around $30 to insure one of his cattle and 10 goats through a new livestock insurance product.\nIt uses satellite imagery to determine forage availability, with payouts triggered when a lack of rain shrinks grazing to less than 20 percent of ideal conditions.\nThe index-based insurance programme is run by the Kenya-based International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), and funded by the British, U.S. and Australian governments and the European Union. The donors subsidise the cover to make it affordable for pastoralists.\nA range of insurance companies sell policies to herders across northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia.\nPROTECTION AGAINST LOSS\nILRI first piloted index-based insurance in Marsabit in 2010.

[nL8N15C3N4]\n\"We expect this to lead to more rapid and sizeable monetary tightening that will further restrain growth,\" Lindow said.\n\"The increase in rates will serve as a further brake on an already weak economy, with an intensifying drought aggravating existing problems that have taken their toll on investor confidence over the past year,\" Lindow said.\nThe central bank slashed its 2016 growth forecast to 0.9 percent from 1.4 percent previously, while the International Monetary Fund sees growth at only 0.7 percent in 2016.\nMoody's said the drought would also stretch South Africa's already wide trade and current account deficits.\nSouth Africa is targeting a budget deficit of less than 4 percent, and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is expected to announce a raft of cost cutting measures when he delivers his speech next Wednesday.\nMoody's currently rates South Africa's debt at two notches above subinvestment, but with a negative outlook.

Most of our animals have crossed to Turkana and herders are grazing peacefully,\" he said.\nDrought in the region has affected school enrollment with most schools in the county recording low numbers since the beginning of the term. School going children have been skipping classes due to the drought. Mutuku said primary schools would be prioritised when distribution of relief food begins. In March last year, thousands of West Pokot residents were facing water shortage, a situation that interrupted learning as pupils were forced to drop out of school in search of pasture and water for their livestock and domestic use.\nCases of miscarriages were reported as pregnant women are forced to walk tens of kilometres in search of water.",

The worst drought in a quarter of a century is expected to exacerbate its problems.\nSaviour Kasukuwere, the local government minister, said in a statement late on Thursday the former British colony had received below 75 percent of normal rains, with up to three quarters of crops failing in some regions.\nHe also said dam levels were falling, and were at an average capacity of 51 percent. Zimbabwe's biggest hydro power plant, Kariba, has cut back electricity generation by 62 percent.\n\"Given the foregoing ... His Excellency, the President has declared a state of disaster to severely affected areas in communal and resettlement lands of Zimbabwe effective from Feb. 2, 2016,\" Kasukuwere said.\nKasukuwere said the number of people requiring food aid had risen to 2.44 million, which is 26 percent of the population.\nThe El Nino weather pattern has brought poor rains to already-parched southern Africa, hitting crops, including in South Africa, the region's biggest maize grower.\nZimbabwe has forecast that the economy would expand by 2.7 percent this year but the World Bank said on Wednesday the drought and weak global commodity prices would see growth of 1.5 percent, the same as last year.",

An estimated 300,000 litres change hands daily in this city of just over 1.6 million inhabitants, with Zimbabwe's finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, saying that imports have reached \"crazy\" proportions.\nBuyers include poor families as well as rich, and such is the upswing of demand that bottled water now outsells alcohol and soft drinks in some desperately thirsty neighbourhoods.\nThe reason for the boom is simple: what's coming out of the tap in many homes and businesses is increasingly undrinkable.\n\"Municipal water is smelly. Often we see visible dirty particles floating,\" Precious Shumba, chair of the Harare Residents' Trust, the biggest civic pressure group in the city, said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nDISEASE THREAT\nAs water quality declines, in part the result of worsening drought, some families who drink or bathe in what comes out of the tap are becoming sick with problems from rashes to typhoid, health authorities say.\nThe capital has grappled with problems providing clean water for most of a decade, but an extended drought, crippling power cuts, a cash-short municipal government and an exodus of qualified water engineers mean the city now produces only about 40 percent of the water needed, Shumba said.\nAbout half of the city's water is lost through leaks in failing distribution pipes on its way to homes, and illegal connections are also a problem, water engineers say.\nResidents nervous about what's coming out of their taps have increasingly turned to alternatives for drinking water. Domestic refrigerators are packed with containers of imported or local purified water.\nIn many homes, the city's municipal water is only used for bathing, gardening, laundry, or watering animals.",

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon during a tour of an area where one of the worst droughts in decades has left children malnourished, killed livestock and damaged livelihoods.\nThe relief operation by the government, World Food Programme (WFP) and charities needs $1.4 billion this year. The government says donors have covered about 30 percent so far. The WFP says $500 million is needed to continue operations beyond April.\n\"Our government is committed to allocating the budget and mobilizing any resources to the target groups,\" Demeke told reporters at a food and cash distribution point in Ogolcho, a region south of the capital Addis Ababa.\n\"The action of the international community is very critical and that should be on time,\" he added.\nThe drought is as severe in some areas as the one in 1984, when conflict and failed rains caused a famine that killed a million people. Ethiopia now has one Africa's fastest growing economies, but the crisis is still straining the nation.\nThe government spent $272 million last year on relief and has allocated $109 million so far this year, a hefty burden in a country which remains one of the poorest in Africa per capita and where many people rely on subsistence farming.\nBefore flying by helicopter to Ogolcho, Ban met in Addis Ababa with government officials, U.N. agency staff and representatives of donors, such as the European Union and the United States, both major contributors.\n\"We are doing all we can, mobilising necessary funding,\" Ban said, praising the government for taking the lead while noting that \"they have limited resources.\"\nBan, in Ethiopia for an African Union summit that ended on Sunday, toured a small health post in the Ogolcho area where children are checked for malnourishment.\nOgolcho is in Ziway Dudga district, where the main harvest almost completely failed last year.

        "text": "Forward-thinking farmers in drought-hit Zambia are planning to trim the amount of maize they plant, switching to faster-growing crops such as beans that can better survive erratic weather.\n\"I will have to stop growing maize and find other crops to sustain our livelihood because we have had no rains this season,\" said Sinoya Phiri, a 42-year-old peasant farmer in Katyoka village, around 27 km (16.78 miles) south of the capital Lusaka.\nHe usually plants his maize crop between November 15 and 20, at the onset of the rainy season, but last year the rains did not come except for one downpour in mid-December.\n\"Since then we haven't had any rains, and if it doesn't rain in the next week, with this extraordinary heat, I am afraid even the little surviving crop will dry up completely,\" Phiri said in early January.\nThe abnormal conditions have prompted him to start keeping pigs and chickens, as well as try out crops like sugar beans and soya beans, which mature more quickly than maize.\nZambia faces a critical food shortage as most areas where food crops are grown, concentrated in the south, have been hit by the current dry spell.\nThe majority of peasant farmers depend on the rains to irrigate their maize crop, which is used to produce the country's staple food - a maize-meal dish called nshima consumed by most Zambians.\nThe director of the Zambia Meteorological Department (ZMD), Jacob Nkomoki, said the dry spell was a result of the El Nino weather phenomenon which has brought drought conditions to southern Africa, combined with dry air flowing from the southeast of the continent.\nIt has mainly affected southern parts of Zambia, including Southern, Western, Lusaka, Central and Eastern provinces. Nkomoki said most of these places recorded less than 40 mm of rainfall between mid-November and early January.\nOn Jan. 8, Lusaka and some southern areas were hit by a violent hailstorm that left a trail of destruction. It killed five people in the capital, destroyed buildings and washed away already wilted crops.\nFOOD ASSESSMENT",

        "text": "Although floriculture has bloomed in Kenya in the recent past, many farmers remain reluctant to take it up.\nAccording to the Kenya Flower Council, the main cut flowers grown in Kenya are roses, carnations, and alstromeria, gypsophilla, lilies, eryngiums, arabicum, hypericum, statice and a range of summer flowers.\nBut despite a favourable climate and a stable industry, farmers continue to shy away from venturing into new types of ornamental crops due to uncertainty of farming practices and availability of markets.\nAt the recent Nairobi International Trade Fair, Grace Kagochi, an extension officer at the Ministry of Agriculture, was on hand to enlighten farmers on ornamental amaranth farming, a profitable crop mainly grown for export.\nSuitable for almost any climate, ornamental amaranth is easy to grow. Some people grow it in their gardens as its bright red or pink coloured flowers are considered beautiful for landscaping and for indoor flower arrangements.\n\"Ornamental amaranth is drought-resistant. It can grow in all areas,\" says Kagochi. \"When a farmer decides to grow this flower for commercial purposes, he needs to have enough land that is not water-logged to enable the flower grow to maturity.\"\nThe flowers require soft soil to allow the flower's roots access enough water. It is therefore advisable to soften the soil to ensure good drainage and aeration for the flowers bloom to their maximum potential.\nThe soil is then mixed with manure. The width of the bed should be one metre at any length. A handful of fertiliser( DAP) is then applied per square metre. Using a rake, soften the bed until the till is fine as the seeds are very small.\nThe seedbed is then watered and small shallow trenches that are approximately one-inch deep are made with the tip of a finger or a small stick.\n\"You then have to mix your seed with some soil as they are very tiny,\" Kagochi said. \"The ratio of mixing the seed to the soil is 1:10 so that when you drill, many won't fall together at the same point.\"\nThe seeds are covered lightly with small amounts of soil to allow for easy germination, which occurs after five days. \"After the seeds are germinated, your work is just to water the plants. In dry areas, you need to water every evening depending on the stage of growth,\" she said.\nYellowing of the leaves is a sign that the flower is mature for harvesting. But while the leaves of ornamental amaranth are edible, Kagochi does not encourage farmers to use them for food.",

        "text": "National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi Wednesday criticised the government for failing to put in measures to deal with drought in the country.\nHe said it was \"sad\" that three years after one of the region's worst droughts, very little had been done to deal with the situation.\nIn a dispatch of his presentation in Daegu, South Korea, Muturi reeled off statistics showing a grim situation in Kenya.\nIn his maths, \"poor drinking water quality and poor sanitation costs Kenya Sh27 billion every year; health care costs Sh4.3 billion; access time Sh2.2 billion, and Sh300 million in productivity losses\".\nThe premature deaths as a result of waterborne diseases cost Sh20 billion, the Speaker added.\nHe told the conference of MPs and Speakers from all over the world that unless regional bodies such as the African Union make sure water issues are fixed, then, the much-sought after better life will remain a mirage.\n\n\"The situation we face is desolate, yet the future survival of millions of citizens of this planet and the generations to come demand immediate and effective action now. We cannot wait,\" said Muturi.\n\nMuturi said the Water Bill, 2014, which is waiting for the final reading - the Third Reading in the National Assembly-will partly address the water problems in the country. He said the Bill, once enacted, will open the policy and regulation doors to allow Kenyans to realise the \"right to clean drinking water\" as envisaged in the Constitution.\n\"The Bill comes on the heels of wide ranging reforms to the Kenyan water sector to improve water governance. It is expected to set the standards and structures necessary to fulfill these rights. Ensuring the access to clean drinking water and improved sanitation for our citizens is therefore a priority,\" said Muturi.\nHe asked MPs, in the next budget, to put money into dealing with the issue of water scarcity and to keep the Executive on toes in making sure that people, especially the poor had access to clean water.\n\"The protection of water resources and provision of water services requires large investments of public funds...Parliaments should play an active role to oversight government institutions with regard to water governance and ensure implementation of laws by the executive. This is especially critical in requiring the executive to mitigate environmental degradation, climate change, and disaster risk reduction,\" said Muturi.",

        "text": "In August, 2009 the last time a drought and famine of the magnitude building up in Kenya hit the nation, the then infant Grand Coalition Government launched an ambitious emergency response programme to provide rapid delivery of food, water and medicine to over 10 million Kenyans in arid and semi arid areas of most affected by the prolonged drought.\nPrime Minister Raila Odinga, then in charge of coordination of government, together with President Mwai Kibaki were able to put together a response programme to address serious challenges on the government coping mechanisms posed by the unprecedented deterioration of food security. At that time, the rains had failed for the fourth consecutive year.\nKibaki and Raila were able to roll out a multi-faceted rapid response programme that was simultaneously launched in eleven arid and semi arid districts at Loiyangalani trading centre in Marsabit North District.\nAt the time, Kenyans agreed that it was the first time they witnessed a government go all out in the interest of citizens. Such a response had never been seen before.\nAbout six years later, a government that came to power boasting the youthfulness of its leadership and digital capabilities appears to be caught napping by a drought that has barely lasted six months. The government is also distracted by scandals and wrong priorities and paralyzed by ineptitude while citizens suffer and die.\nDespite four years of its key members led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto running around the country making all sorts of promises; from livestock insurance to crop insurance and massive irrigation, Jubilee has been caught asleep.\nAs pastoralists loose their livestock in record numbers while millions in arid and semi arid lands face starvation, Jubilee is still making promises and addressing State House Summits on how to address the problem which is rapidly spreading.\nODM is sick and tired of this inaction. We are disturbed at this apparent lack of action plan and the all talk and promise and no action. Consequently:\n1. ODM demands that the President immediately unleashes State resources and put them at the disposal and service of suffering Kenyans in all parts of the country.\n2. ODM demands the immediate deployment of all relevant personnel, including the disciplined forces in the distribution of food, water and hay to all affected communities.\n3. We demand the immediate release of money to buy livestock affected by drought to save the pastoralists from the losses in line with the trend the Grand Coalition Government initiated.\n4. We demand that the President immediately flags off livestock off-take by Kenya meat commission and other private sector agencies like Farmers' Choice and Quality Meat Packers to save our people.\n5. We demand the immediate launch of massive borehole drilling and distribution of food and water to all affected families across the country.\n6. ODM also demands that the government ends with immediate effect the hostilities in the Kerio Valley pitting the Pokot against the Marakwet, which have led to loss of hundreds of lives and left many children orphaned and schools closed while the government goes about daily routines as if nothing is happening. The lives of the Pokot and the Marakwet are as precious as that of any other Kenyan.\nWe are considering other measures of legal and political nature to ensure the people in the affected areas get what is due to them if the government does not immediately swing into action.\n1. Hon Abdikadir Aden, MP, Mbalambala/ National Organising Secretary ODM.\n2. Hon Junet Mohammed, MP, Suna East/ Director of Campaigns ODM.\nOCTOBER 20, 2016.",

        "text": "Carcasses of cattle and desperate faces of children, women and elderly people are prevalent in Kinango, Kwale county, where a four-month drought has left residents starving, as the government delays to provide food and water.\nThe county has more than 200,000 starving residents, with hundreds of cattle reportedly dying every day. At Mwaruwesa village in Samburu ward, where the Star visited on Wednesday, carcasses of cattle, goats and sheep were scattered in the field and outside residents' compounds. We counted up to 20 carcasses of cattle after being welcomed by a filthy smell.\nThe situation is devastating. Residents say they are waiting to die after their cattle, if the government does not intervene urgently. The presence of carcasses around homes poses a health hazard, but residents have nowhere to go.\nFatuma Dzeha, 50, said her family had gone for two days without food. Children were not spared, as they welcomed us with a disturbing shriek of hunger.\n\"The porridge I'm making is for my family of 10 people for the afternoon. We don't know when we will have the next meal because there is no food,\" said Fatuma as she prepared a porridge outside their house.\nAreas affected include Kasemeni, Kinango, Ndavaya, Puma and Samburu-Chengoni in Kinango, among others. Even as the county and national government claimed to have been working out ways to help the starving citizens, Fatuma said they have not seen any intervention since July, when the drought started.\n\"There is no water around and so we are forced to drink the available dirty water at the drying water pans, since the fresh water is 50km away at Sh400, which we cannot afford,\" she said. \"Sometimes we take the entire day or two looking for water.\"\nAbout nine water pans around Chanzou and Mwaruvesa have dried up, leaving residents pleading with the government to provide water.\n\"A packet of maize flour goes for Sh110 at the shop, which is 25km from our homes. It is expensive because the charcoal business we have been relying on for food is not working out,\" she said.\nFatuma said they have been forced to go for months without bathing, let alone washing their clothes.\n\"We are asking the President and his government to intervene urgently for us to get water and food. Children are in danger of dying of hunger,\" she said.\nHer husband Hussein Dzeha said getting a meal for his family has become a big headache because of the drought.\n\"I have lost cattle because of no water and pasture. When relief food comes, it is distributed discriminatively. I want to tell the President that we are also Kenyans and we need him to intervene so our lives can be saved,\" he said.\nJumaa Mbui, a resident at Mwaruvesa village, is in a similar fix. Mbui said if the drought persists, after the cattle deaths, residents will follow, since there is no food and water. \"It will be unfortunate if we will die because of hunger when we have a sitting government,\" he said.\nMbui said when hunger bites, they are forced to turn to certain trees for food, although they are sometimes poisonous. He said the area has not had rains for two years, noting that the last time the government supplied relief food was back in 2007, which he said was distributed discriminatively.\n\"Children are walking about 20km to go to school with an empty stomach, which is a problem. Because of that, many remain at home,\" he said.\nAbout 20km from Mwaruvesa is Chanzohu village in Samburu ward, where 100 cattle, goats and sheep have died due to lack of water and pasture, including 20 cattle belonging to one family.\nHerder Chengo Mwachondo said the situation is worrying and that he fears losing his job since his boss may lose all his cattle to the drought.\n\"I have been doing this work for a long time, but I have never seen such drought in my life. There is no grass and water for cattle. Some of them died while I was taking them to drink water and I left them on the way,\" he said.\nMwachondo said other cattle died at their compound and were buried, while others were left to decay since the situation is getting out of hand.\n\"Sometimes while grazing, I tried to help those cattle falling down to walk, but they die as you watch helplessly. It's a terrible situation for us in Kinango,\" the herder said.\n\"I have witnessed over 100 cattle dying since the drought started. Cattle, goats, sheep, forcing the owner to transfer them cattle to safe areas.\"\nResident Naomi Mutisya said they have been forced to take the cattle to Galana and Kaloleni, where there is enough water and plenty of grass for them.\n\"We have more than 500 cattle and so we feared more would die, which is a very big loss to farmers,\" she said.\nShe said children are helping their parents to prepare charcoal since there is no money for school fees.\n\"As we are talking, we have pupils in the bush, helping their parents to cut trees and prepare charcoal for them to get food,\" she said. \"It is high time the government protects its people. You can imagine as women, we don't bath and it is worse our husbands cannot provide our marital needs. We are worried our families will break.\"\nBreastfeeding mothers are also at the risk of spreading diseases to children since they stay for many days without bathing. They say the Health department should intervene.\nMwaruvesa resident Nadzua Jotto, 80, told the Star she had gone for two days without food, until on Wednesday when she took a cup of tea from a good neighbour.\n\"I have about 10 grandchildren who are starving, but I have no food to give them. They are living at the mercy of God,\" she said.\nThe last time she saw relief food was 15 years ago, when Kinango MP Gonzi Rai was seeking votes to be elected.\n\"We are asking Governor Salim Mvurya to also look at his people. We need food and water. We walk a long distance to get water. We are really suffering. We are forced to drink dirty water at the drying water pans since we have no options,\" the elderly woman said.\nNyondo Mrisa, 70, said he has lost 10 goats with no hopes the government will compensate or help him.\n\"Kinango people, we need government intervention for us not to die of hunger. The government is taking long to respond,\" he said.\nKwale human rights network coordinator Gorge Jaramba said the plight is heartbreaking. \"We have seen children, women and elders with no food, no water, and they are just waiting to die. We have national and county governments, which have not helped so far. It is a shame,\" he said.\nHe said since food is a basic need, the government should play its role instead of waiting to respond to deaths of starving people.\n\"We are not in Somalia or DRC Congo or a war-torn country but a peaceful one. The government has the role of helping its citizens. The county should go to all areas affected and use all means, even if is getting well-wishers from abroad, for people to get food,\" he said.\nJaramba said civil society groups have come together and started fundraising to help the starving residents.\nHe said the areas where cattle have died should be frequented by health officials to ensure residents around are not affected since it is a health hazard in waiting.\n\"The county government should come up with policies of solving this issue once and for all. We also want the government to come up with a special fund to help farmers losing cattle due to drought,\" he said.\nKinango subcounty commissioner Moses Ivuto said the government is committed to help them.\n\"The government is planning to distribute relief food to residents at the weekend,' he said.",

It is here that most of the residents quench their thirst, at least with the diminishing hope that help will come some day later.\nWith the hopes of the many women, children and the elderly resting with well-wishers that they expect to rescue them with food and water, the situation has only raised the levels of despair among them.\nIn the face of the despair, lives of residents and livestock in Baragoi, South Horr, Barseloi, Suyan, Loonjorin, Opiroi area, Nachola and many other parts of the county are endangered.\nIn Samburu East, the most affected parts are Wamba, Mugur, Londuokwe, Ngaroni, Ngilai and Sereolipi where young men have to go out in search for pasture and water for their animals.\nIt is reported that most of the affected persons line up on the roads asking for food supplies from any well-wisher who might pass by.\n\"We have been living in this condition for the last two weeks. We have no one to help us or support us with food and water,\" a resident said.\nThere is imminent danger of an outburst of conflict as differences among the groups scrambling for the already scarce resources escalate.\n\"My husband left with our camels to go and look for pasture and water four days ago and he is yet to return. Some of our old family members are left in the Manyatta's without food or water,\" one of the affected women said.\nPauline Nasieku, a pregrant woman and mother of a 2 year-old, said that she spent more than three nights to reach Opiroi.\nAt Loonjorin area in the northern parts of Samburu, some 100 kilometres away from the area, a team of Morans are drilling a well in search of water for their livestock and for domestic use.\n\"We cannot wait to die of thirst or sit and watch our livestock die because we have no water, we decided to come here and look for a solution,\" said John Lenolkirina.\nThe residents are now calling upon the government and well wishers to come to their aid.\nThey said that those keeping camels are depending on the animal's milk as the only way to survive.\nA number of youth and men from the pastoralist communities from the neighboring Marsabit, Isiolo, Baringo and Turkana counties have been forced to move for up to 120 kilometres in search for water and pasture.\nSamburu county, working with with the national government under the National Drought Management Authority, had promised to supply of relief food to the affected families.\nThis was to start early this week but is yet to be actualised as more people stream to Opiroi in wait.\nRead: 1.3 million Kenyans face starvation",

        "text": "A humanitarian crisis looms in Garissa county as thousands of pastoralist families grapple with worsening drought.\nA large population is stricken by the persistent dry spell. Water sources are drying up, pastures depleted and livestock and human lives threatened. Victims have appealed to the government and the international community to speedily intervene.\nResidents rely heavily on the few remaining water points. The water is unsafe. It has changed colour and developed a foul smell due to contamination.\nThey converge there with their animals to share the limited resource for survival. Fresh buffalo carcasses were strewn 100 metres from one of the water points. Residents said they died of exhaustion.\nMany people have to trek more than 30 kilometres to get water for drinking and domestic use.\nIjara subcounty is one of the worst-hit areas. Schools and health facilities are on the verge of shut-down. Administrators fear keeping the children and patients around because it could expose them to more danger.\nResidents said waterborne diseases such as cholera could easily break out and spread because they lack clean water.\nA spot check showed children already show symptoms of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea. When the Star visited the only water dam in Korisa location in Ijara subcounty, it was a beehive of activities. Residents were busy drawing the visibly foul-smelling contaminated water. At some points, they had to compete with thirsty livestock and wild animals.\nScores of goats and cows, which were weak and emaciated after long treks, became stuck in the mud. Owners had to pull them out.\n\"Thirsty wild animals are 'fighting' with people over access to the only water source in this area. Residents were forced to take turns day and night to keep buffaloes away from the dam. But now we have given up,\" resident Haret Nasteh said. \"It's extremely risky to ward off the thirsty animals as they come in big numbers and force themselves in to drink the water.\"\nHe said most livestock moved deep into Boni Forest, which lies between Ijara and Lamu, as the drought worsened. \"This is our only water source. We urgently appeal to the government and international community to come to our aid. The problem is getting out of hand fast,\" Nasteh said.\nAccording to the Garissa county's National Drought Management Authority, the dry spell has reached an alarming stage.\nIt said unlike previous dry spells, which only affected families in the hinterlands, the current drought has destabilised people living along rivers. Human-wildlife conflict has surged. Thirsty wild animals invade human settlement to get water.\nActing NDMA county coordinator Abdinoor Dubow said although there are no deaths of livestock so far, it is unavoidable, unless there is urgent intervention. He said most livestock markets are not functioning and the purchasing power of the pastoralists has dropped significantly.\n\"We appeal to donors to intervene as the situation is getting out of hand,\" Dubow said.",

        "text": "As prolonged drought dries up waterholes and grass, Zimbabwe's government is taking an unprecedented step to keep the wildlife in its game reserves alive: It is selling the animals to private owners.\nZimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority has invited bids to purchase the animals in its reserves, hoping private game reserves with cash and spare water and fodder may be able to get them through the worst drought the country has seen in three decades.\nZimParks, as the conservation authority is known, has not specified what animals might be sold, their cost or whether they could be exported to other countries. But the country's wildlife includes a range of big tourist draws, including elephants, rhinos and lions.\n\"We have asked individuals and private gamekeepers to step in and buy wild animals in the light of the drought, but the number of animals to be sold would depend on the bids we receive,\" ZimParks spokesperson, Caroline Washaya-Moyo, told journalists.\nOppah Muchinguri, Zimbabwe's minister for environment, water and climate, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the country aimed to use resources from the sales to support the other animals in its reserves through the drought.\n\"We must mobilise resources for the upkeep of our wild animals, like elephants, by selling,\" he said.\nThe Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency estimates that 620 Cape buffalo died in 2015 as a result of the ongoing drought. Such statistics are one of the drivers of the current auction.\nThere are no clear reports about the about the number of wild animals the country has sold so far, but last year Zimbabwe exported to China 100 elephants, out of a population of more than 84,000, according to ZimParks. Each fetched $40,000.\nIn the past, the country has offered a range of animals for sale, including elephants, lions, impala antelope and zebras.\n'Stealing the future'?\nTo auction animals, ZimParks authorities have invited \"expressions of interest\" from bidders with the capacity to manage the wildlife. Bidders are required to pay a non-refundable fee of $50.\nBut critics warn the selloff could both hurt the future earning power of the country's national parks and fuel corruption.\n\"Selling wildlife here has nothing to do with the El Nino-induced drought or any excuse; this is mismanagement, corruption and greed.\nThe government is stealing from the future generation of this country,\" charged Johnny Rodrigues, chairman of the animal rights group, Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force.\nHe said the government had warned as early as July 2015 that a strong El Nino phenomenon threatened to dry up pastures and drinking water and impact wildlife.\n\"So why didn't they store food for wildlife way in advance, knowing that Zimbabwe has droughts periodically?\" he asked.\nIn 2014, the government earned about $6 million from game viewing, according to the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate.\nRodrigues said those who will benefit from wildlife sales include Zimbabwe's government and private game reserves, whose workers are now taking a look at what's available.\nLeander Saburi, an independent animal rights activist, said it remains unclear whether animals sold would remain in Zimbabwe.\n\"Nobody knows whether or not private rangers and farmers purporting to have keen interest in buying the starving wildlife will keep the animals. They could be ivory poachers posing as private game rangers so that they easily gain access to our wildlife,\" he warned.\nZimParks officials said that was not a risk.\n\"Remember there is paperwork needed for one to buy our wildlife and we don't just sell to anyone, and therefore there is no room for poachers,\" said a senior ZimParks official.\nIn line with the ZimParks requirements, bidders for wild animals must provide information about where they intend to keep acquired animals, giving the name and address of the property, its size and its ownership.\nTaking a look\nSome Zimbabwe private game rangers, such as John Harugwa, have met the requirements.\nHarugwa recently took a peek through the security fence at Gonarezhou National Park outside Masvingo, in southeast Zimbabwe. On the parched ground inside lay a herd of Cape buffalo, resting near a dried-up dam.\n\"Our country's failure to look after its wildlife amid the drought may be our turn to make money as we gain dominance in the business of wildlife and start pocketing cash from game viewing. Some of us have the means to keep the animals alive,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nWhat's clear, he said, is that \"wildlife authorities don't have enough capacity to carry the country's wildlife through the drought\".\nHarugwa's new private game reserve, called HaruPark in Zimbabwe's Masvingo Province, covers about 85 hectares of former farmland that he recently converted into a game park for tourists.\nHe is amongst 8,000 drought-affected smallholder farmers here benefitting from the U.N. Central Emergency Fund, which aims to help farmers acquire subsidised feed for their livestock.\nHarugwa said he had accessed approximately 2,000 tonnes of animal feed at subsidised prices, thanks to the U.N. initiative.",

        "text": "Four years ago, 42-year-old Annet Wangari worked as a farm labourer, earning Sh150 per day.\nHowever, her life has drastically changed, thanks to an irrigation project initiated by Trocaire in collaboration with Ishiara Catholic Parish in Ishiara area, Embu county.\n\"We used to survive on relief food, working as labourers at Kanyuambora farms, which is 10km away from Ishiara. The Sh150 I was paid was not enough to feed my family and take my children to secondary school,\" says the mother of seven.\nWangari now sells at least 300kg of pawpaw weekly at a cost of Sh25 per kg. From a casual labourer, she is now an employer, paying her farmhands Sh300 per day.\nShe also sells mangoes and green maize from her two-acre plot. Her clients come from as far as Nairobi.\nJospeter Njeru, 62, who was also a casual labourer, is another beneficiary of the project.\nIn 2000, Njeru relocated to Embu town. He was looking for opportunities to feed and educate his children and opted to go into farming.\n\"Year after year, I watched helplessly as the drought ravaged my crops,\" he said.\nHe says the irrigation project was godsend. \"I now grow various crops and have enough water for my livestock,\" Njeru said.\nHe has planted more than 200 pawpaw stems and maize that he sells to individual buyers from Embu and Nairobi towns. \"This season alone I was able to sell green maize worth Sh50,000 from my half-acre piece of land, which I could not make before as plants dried one month after planting,\" Njeru said.\nHe has also increased the number of his livestock because access to water has enabled him to practise zero grazing.\n\"I used to travel at least 10km to River Thuthi that borders Embu and Tharaka-Nthi counties to fetch water for my livestock. That forced me to limit the number of animals I could keep,\" he said.\nWith income from mixed farming, Njeru can comfortably provide for his family.\nIshiara Catholic Parish programme officer Catherine Mururi says up to 80 per cent of the families in the area do not have enough food and income to educate their children.\n\"When crops fail, people sell their animals and the few assets they have to buy food. Eventually they are forced to look for employment because they have nothing else to sell,\" Mururi said.\nShe said the project has enhanced food security and boosted famiy incomes.\nThe project, which was launched in 2012, has benefitted more than 700 households so far. It aims to provide a lasting solution to the perpetual water and food problems in the area, forcing residents to depend on relief food.\nMururi says before the project was started, each household used to get four kilogrammes of maize, 13 kilogrammes of maize, and two kilogrammes of cooking oil monthly.\n\"Getting an education beyond primary school was a problem for those without a sustainable source of income. Ishiara Catholic Parish, in collaboration with Trocaire, had been providing relief food to the families to reduce their suffering,\" said Mururi.\nTrocaire Arid and Semi-Arid Land Resilience senior programme officer Francis Emoru said the initiative is an answer to the perennial food problem in the area. \"We initiated a livelihood project by buying five goats for most vulnerable households and chicken to people living with HIV/Aids,\" he said.\n\"To support the reach and impact of the livelihood project, Trocaire introduced comprehensive training on crop resilience and alternative livelihoods - entrepreneurial training and loans for the youth and women - to improve the income of vulnerable households,\" he said.\nEmoru said through the partnership with the Augustinian Missionaries in Ishiara Catholic Parish, the project now focuses on building social, economic, and environmental resilience through adoption of climate sensitive agriculture, ecological conservations, access to market, and advocacy, particularly on water resources.\n\"The overall objective of the project is to provide people in Ishiara area with alternative sources of food and income when crops fail as they can sell goats, chicken and survive on income from their businesses.",

        "text": "Elliot Nzarayebani, a farmer in Zimunya, a small community near Mutare city, expects to have to rely on food handouts due to the drought ravaging his maize.\n\"Crops are wilting right in front of our eyes. The situation is desperate,\" said the 45 year-old father of four.\nThe maize planted in November, 2015 in this part of eastern Zimbabwe is wilting fast, while some crops planted late in December that year never even germinated.\n\"We are not expecting much help from our government because it's broke,\" said Nzarayebani. \"We hope NGOs will chip in with food aid for us to survive through the year.\"\nThere is fear and anxiety among Zimbabwe's farmers as the country faces yet another damaging drought.\nThis time around, experts attribute it to the El Nino weather phenomenon that has delayed the onset of the rains in several southern African countries.\nZimbabwe is still smarting from a drought that hit farmers in the 2014/15 season, wiping out half the country's maize crop, the main staple food.\nThis year the drought is predicted to be worse, and farmers' organisations are reporting that maize crops in some parts of the country are already a write-off.\nEven though El Nino has been in the news in recent months, many people in remote rural areas are unaware of it and have been caught off-guard.\n\"Who's El Nino?\" Nzarayebani asked blankly.\nEl Nino occurs when the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean warm, altering rainfall patterns worldwide. Zimbabwe has a 70 per cent chance of experiencing drought under El Nino conditions, experts say.\nDroughts have become recurrent in Zimbabwe since a devastating dry spell in 1991/92 that killed more than 1 million cattle, according to the country's agriculture ministry.\nA drought in 1997/98 also hit livestock and crops badly, leading to food shortages that triggered riots.\nNo harvest expected\nThis year the hardest-hit provinces include Manicaland, Masvingo, Matabeleland South, Midlands and Mashonaland West. In some areas, temperatures soared as high as 43 degrees Celsius (109.4F) between September and January.\nIn Mutasa district, Manicaland province, most of the early planted maize crop was wilting in January.\n\"We are no longer expecting any harvest,\" said one farmer from the district, Claris Mutasa.\nIn parts of Manicaland, some families have already resorted to eating baobab fruits.\n\"We go for up to four days without a proper meal,\" said Joseph Mtisi from Gudyanga in Chimanimani district. \"People here are surviving on porridge made from baobab fruits, but the fruits are running out too.\"\nMtisi is one of many trying to earn a living by selling baobab fruit and mats made from baobab bark to motorists along the Mutare-Masvingo highway in Manicaland.\nBulawayo South legislator Eddie Cross told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the situation is set to become \"critical\".\nThe agricultural expert and economist said 2.7 million tonnes of maize will be required for national consumption from January 2016 to June 2017.\nThe national grain reserve, the Grain Marketing Board, has 150,000 tonnes in stock, while the private sector has 119,000 tonnes, and has committed to import 90,000 tonnes. Maize production in the 2015/16 season is now estimated at 200,000 tonnes, Cross said.\nThat translates into an expected supply shortfall of over 2 million tonnes, or 120,000 tonnes a month, he added.\nThe total cost of imports through to June 2017 is estimated at around $870 million (Sh89 billion).\n\"It will put a severe burden on our foreign exchange earnings,\" Cross said.\nGovernment to the rescue?\nIncomes in Zimbabwe are low and declining, and ordinary people will find it difficult to pay for maize meal at prices 70 per cent higher than last year, he added.\nBut Zimbabwe's Agriculture Minister Joseph Made was quoted in local media as saying the government would allocate $260 million (Sh26.6 billion) to import between 500,000 and 700,000 tonnes of maize.\n\"It is the government's responsibility to be the main supplier of food,\" Made was quoted as saying in state-owned newspaper, The Herald.\nThe Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee expects that 1.49 million people will be food insecure from January through March, up from 0.56 million last year, according to a UN update.\nZimbabwe imported maize from Malawi, Zambia and South Africa in 2015, but with these countries also experiencing drought, the government is now planning to import the staple from Brazil.\nWalter Chidhakwa, Zimbabwe's minister for mining, told a meeting of the ruling party Zanu PF in January that the government would identify a basket of minerals - likely to include diamonds and gold - over the next six months that could be sold to establish a chest of funds to import food.\nBut not everyone agrees that the government will be able to come to the rescue of small-scale farmers like Nzarayebani.\n\"Support from donors is going to be critical,\" said legislator Cross. \"The government cannot play a significant role as it does not have resources.\"",

        "text": "A scorching drought in Southern Africa that led to widespread crop failure could nudge African nations to finally embrace genetically modified (GM) crops to improve harvests and reduce grain imports.\nThe drought, which extends to South Africa, the continent's biggest maize producer, has been exacerbated by an El Nino weather pattern and follows dry spells last year that affected countries from Zimbabwe to Malawi.\nAid agency Oxfam has said 10 million people, mostly in Africa, face hunger because of droughts and poor rains.\nThat has brought GM crops to the fore, especially maize, a staple crop grown and consumed in most sub-Saharan countries.\nMany African countries have banned GM crops, arguing that they will cross contaminate other plants, pollute the environment and could have long-term health effects for humans.\nZimbabwe, for instance, says although GM crops may initially be resistant to pests, the resistance could breakdown over time.\nGMO advocates, however, say the fears are not scientifically proven, adding that poor African farmers are likely to benefit most from reduced use of pesticides, lower production costs, higher yields and high prices for crops.\nThe African drought's impact is particularly serious for Zimbabwe, where the economy has struggled for five years to recover from a catastrophic recession marked by billion percent hyperinflation and widespread food shortages.\nZimbabwe does not accept GM maize imports, and when it has accepted emergency GM maize aid, it has been milled under security watch.\n\"GM crops are one of the alternative solutions for reducing hunger on the continent among many others which include good agronomic practices,\" Jonathan Mufandaedza, chief executive at National Biotechnology Authority of Zimbabwe, a government agency, told Reuters.\nThe United States, Brazil and India are the world's largest growers of GM crops while in Africa, South Africa is the only country producing GM maize on a commercial scale.\nSixteen percent of Zimbabwe's population require food aid this year. The government plans to import up to 700,000 tonnes of maize and with its usual sources of maize like Zambia and Tanzania facing lower harvests this year, Zimbabwe could end up receiving GM maize after all.\nThis year, South Africa, which produces more than 40 per cent of Southern African maize may need to import up to 5 million tonnes of maize due to drought, the country's largest producer group, Grain SA said this week.\nPerceptions are shifting, with Burkina Faso in West Africa, and lately Sudan having started to grow GM cotton commercially, Getachew Belay, an African expert on GM crops told Reuters.\n\"Historically, Africa has been a laggard to accept new agricultural technologies. For GM crops, much of the problem lies in the perception, exaggerated fear and conflicting messages sent to policy making,\" said Belay.\nGM policy flip-flops\nIn 2002, Zambia experienced a severe drought that left millions in need of food aid but it rejected GM maize offered by donors, citing inadequate scientific information.\nBut last month, Zambia's Higher Education Minister Michael Kaingu told parliament his country was embracing GM crops.\n\"We recognise that modern biotechnology has advanced worldwide and, as a nation, we cannot afford to ignore the benefits of this technology. We are alert and prepared to deal with possible adverse risks,\" said Kaingu.\nIt is a growing trend on the continent and Belay said Ethiopia had amended its biosafety laws to allow tests on GM cotton, thanks to pressure from the textile industry that is advocating for the production of cheaper cotton in that country.\nKenya, Uganda, Malawi, Swaziland, Nigeria and Ghana have all been carrying out trials on different GM crops, he said.\nAgrichemicals groups such as Monsanto , the world's largest seed company, and Syngenta are well placed to benefit from increased use of GMOs in Africa.\nMonsanto conducted trials of GM maize and cotton in some African countries, including Zimbabwe between 2001 and 2005.\nBut the transition from tests to commercial growing has been slow, a reminder of the die hard attitudes towards GM crops.\nBelay said a major factor that could influence Africa to start growing GM maize was whether China would grow GM rice, which it has developed but not released for production.\n\"The real issue seems to me is lack of capacity, both physical and human, to enforce regulation, thus attitude is changing from 'rejection' to a kind of 'wait until we have capacity to regulate!',\" said Belay.",

        "text": "Recurrent drought in northern Kenya has seen livestock farmers suffer huge losses.\nGusts of wind blow the dust coming from thousands of animals as they make their way to Urura borehole in Kenya's arid northern Merti ward.\nThe well is set in a grazing area reserved for use only during severe drought periods. This dry month, about 3,000 cows, 12,000 goats and 1,800 donkeys access the strategic water reserve every day.\nAbdi Matoiye from Biligi village and his 100 cows have walked for about 20 kilometres (12 miles) to get here - and it's not just the water that is the attraction.\nMatoiye recently lost a cow after it was bitten by wild dogs infected with rabies. Now he is worried that the calf is showing signs of the disease too. Fortunately, a veterinarian is available to answer this distress call.\n\"A cow gets infected by sniffing bites from the bitten cow,\" Matoiye believes. \"We are worried that more cows might die since we are sharing the grazing area and the borehole.\"\nREAD: Governors raise alarm over drought\nAlso read: JICA hands over Sh350m water projects in Turkana\nNorthern Kenya, an arid region inhabited by nomadic pastoralists, is increasingly prone to droughts, a problem that has depleted livestock, water and pasture. Migration during drought periods exposes animals to diseases as they converge on remaining grazing land and watering points.\nAnd pasture and water scarcity continue to be a key driving force for conflict between communities as livestock and people move around the counties of Marsabit, Moyale, Garissa, Isiolo and Wajir, locals say.\nBut a two-year effort to bring together a range of adaptations to the worsening drought - including new wells and other water sources, carefully managed grazing reserves and better veterinary care - is helping pastoralists such as Matoiye manage drought better and protect their animals, incomes and families.\nOften such combinations of adaptation efforts - rather than simply one change alone - are the key to building real resilience to worsening climate extremes, experts say. Letting community members decide what needs to change also is important, they say.\nThe Isiolo adaptation pilot project, backed with Sh105 million ($1 million) from the U.K. Department for International Development through the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), encouraged community members to identify investments that would build their resilience to climate change and then financed these projects.\nNow, \"we have white (wet-season), dry (after the rains) and drought grazing areas in Isiolo\", explained Ndiba Ngolicha, the chairman of the local range land user association.\n\"It has only rained for two days within the year but we have not lost a single cow to drought or lack of pasture. Our biggest challenge remains livestock diseases,\" he said.",

Farmers were forced to abandon rice cultivation in favour of less thirsty crops.\nTo survive, Kinyua took to growing tomatoes and French beans on his 4 acres (1.62 hectares), using water from a 40-foot (12.19 m) well he had sunk into his land. But in 2004, another drought struck, and Kinyua's well dried up.\n\"It was so bad I had to sink a deeper well, this time 75 foot deep, and even then the water was only enough to support farming on a quarter acre of land,\" said the father of two.\nAll over Kathigiriri village, farmers have had to carve out boreholes - some up to 100 feet deep - to access water. Every time another dry spell hits the region, farmers are forced to dig deeper to ensure a steady supply of the precious resource.\nOne key problem is a lack of data, experts say. According to the Kenya Water Industry Association, not one of the country's several water regulation agencies, including the Water Resources Management Authority, has reliable data that captures the distribution, quantity and quality of available groundwater.\nAnd that kind of information is essential to help farmers survive and adapt during drought.\n\"Only an estimated 5 percent of the overall national groundwater resource has been documented so far,\" said Mohamed Djelid, director for the United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO) in East Africa.\nFarmers trying to access water have to struggle with a number of challenges, said Djelid. Those include rising demand, limited understanding of groundwater resources, inadequate monitoring systems, rainfall variability and a lack of large reservoirs for water storage.\n\"Proper exploitation of groundwater can bring tangible change to all this,\" he added.\nPrepared for drought\nTo address the problem, UNESCO and Kenya's water ministry began working together this year on the Kenya Groundwater Mapping Programme, which will build a comprehensive database of the nation's groundwater wealth.",

        "text": "The giant New Holland machine rips through the plantation, raising blinding dust in its wake.\nAfter one long trip amid the humming of the engine, it deposits grain into a waiting truck before embarking on a virgin set of rows.\nTens, perhaps hundreds of combine harvesters have pitched tent here, slowing traffic on the Bomet-Nairobi road and bringing roaring business in Narok and other trading centres.\nIt is harvest time at Nkorinkori, the heartland of Narok, East Africa's largest growing wheat belt accounting for the nearly half of the 500,000 tonnes of wheat produced locally.\nAfter years of braving harsh weather and diseases, wheat farmers in the region have a bumper crop this time around.\n\"The crop has been very good this year. Much of it is attributed to the El Nino rains which were facilitative rather than destructive,\" Narok County chief officer in charge of agriculture Christopher Nkunkuu says.\nScientists at the Kenya agricultural Livestock and Research Organization (Kalro) were also instrumental in coming up with varieties that are stress tolerant.\n\"We tested 14 varieties from Kalro and farmers adopted a few of these which have been doing well. They include eagle 10, Korongo and robin.\"\nHe said stem rust has also not been as virulent, giving farmers a breather except during the last few weeks.\nEven then, routine spraying was enough to manage it.\nMr Nkukuu was referring to Ug99, so named because of the country it was first discovered (Uganda), and the year it was named.\nAlso referred to as the polio of agriculture, the disease can wipe out up to 70 per cent of the crop, with most victims being the new unsuspecting farmers who plunge into wheat farming after being lured by tales of fabulous riches to be made in the venture.\nWhile land under wheat has been diminishing due to competition from pasture farming, occasioned by the dairy craze in the county, the trend has been reversed in the last few years after Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease relentlessly attacked maize in the region driving many maize farmers to seek refuge in wheat.\nThe fertiliser subsidy programme also appears to have borne fruit. The government this year imported 104,000 tonnes of fertiliser which the National Cereals and Produce Board was to sell a 50 kilogramme bag to smallholder farmers at Sh1,800, nearly half the Sh3,500 charged by retailers.\nHowever, middlemen soon infiltrated the system and the non-deserving farmers were soon having a field day. Mr Nkukuu says a more effective system would be one in which a universal price was set, even if it was not as low as the present one.\nMIGRATORY BIRD MENACE\nThis year the crop also came under attack by the quelea, a migratory bird species that can consume thousands of acres of crop in a week.\n\"We found an estimated nine million in Duka Moja, Nkareta and Nkorinkori. The roosts were destroyed by aircraft from the Desert Locust Control Organisation for Eastern Africa - the regional body in charge after we informed them,\" Mr Nkukuu informed us.\nEach bird consumes 10 grammes a day, and if uninterrupted by farmers who scare them away, the nine million birds could have decimated 90 tonnes a day.\"\nMr Nkukuu calls for more preparedness to minimise damage whose extent he said would only be clear after complete harvesting.\n\"As a country we need to be more prepared in controlling the migratory birds. We had a slow response because we don't have enough planes. The quality of the fleet has to improve.\"\nNarok last year produced 169,000 tonnes of wheat, earning the farmers slightly over Sh6bilion. The estimated harvest this year are 187,884 tonnes, reflecting a 30 per cent increase. Many farmers expect 12 bags from an acre and above.\nDespite this bumper harvest, however, low prices occasioned by cheap imports have continued to plague the sector. The 10 per cent import duty slapped by the East African Community common market four years ago has seen millers opt for wheat from such countries as Russia.\nKenya is a wheat-deficit country relying on imports to meet the growing demand for the product.\nKenyan farmers produce between 30 and 40 per cent ( about 350, 000 tonnes) of the second most important staple food, which is grown in Narok, Nakuru, Njoro, Uasin Gishu and Timau.\nA Combine harvester harvesting wheat at Ilmashariani, Narok. PHOTO | GEORGE SAYAGIE | NATION MEDIA GROUP\nIt ships in two-thirds of total requirements to meet the annual consumption of close to one billion tonnes of wheat each year.\nThe latest food security report from the Ministry of Agriculture indicates that millers imported 492,371 bags of wheat between January and May 2016.\nLast year, Kenya's wheat imports hit Sh35.6 billion, representing a 5.3 per cent jump from Sh33.8 billion in 2014 and Sh30 billion a year earlier, according to data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.\nREPRIEVE TO FARMERS\nOn Monday, local farmers got a reprieve after a meeting between Agriculture CS Willy Bett and millers agreed that the latter should mop up local wheat even as they went about importing.\n\"We agreed that the 18 millers should divide the local produce between themselves which stands at 840,000 bags for the large scale farmers and 630,000 bags for the small holder farmers - and report to the ministry on what number and from which farmers they have bought,\" the Narok chapter of the Cereals Growers Association chairman Lesiamon ole Koonyo said.\nThe ministry and the millers confirmed the agreement.\nThe millers will buy the wheat at Sh3,000 a bag even though they get imported wheat at Sh2,650. The collection point will be at the National Cereals and Produce Board where each bag will be charged Sh45 for handling and storage charges.\nThis will be shared with millers paying Sh25 and the grain association footing Sh20.\nMr John Ntaiyia, the Narok CGA treasurer, called on the memorandum to cover the yet to be planted wheat in the upper zone of the county.\nNarok has two climatic zones. While the farmers in the lowlands (Nkorinkori, Nkareta, Ololulung'a, Katakala, Ntulele and Duka Moja) have begun harvesting, those in the highlands such as Olokurto, Entiyani, Oloropil and Olpusimoru are now planting.\nINCREASE WHEAT IMPORT DUTY\nMr Nyaiyia said the world lobby of cereals growers took part in the negotiations because Kenya's wheat has one of the highest bushel weights.\nDr David ole Sankok, the Narok Central Business Association chairman said this year's bumper harvest had breathed a new life into the fast-growing farming and resort town. \"This harvest, coupled with increased tourist numbers, has returned the town to its lost glory.\"\nOther leaders, however, called for more to be done to enable farmers return a profit, saying the cost of farming had shot through the skies in recent years.\nMr Suki Singh, a CGA director, called on the government to protect local farmers, and by extension the local economy, by increasing import duty to 35 per cent.\nWheat farmer, Hugo Wood, warned that food security was jeopardised if the government would not stop the importation of wheat in favour of local produce.\n****\nGet it quick\nwhat it costs to plant wheat per acre",

Instead of lining, you can wear stockings when you need additional warmth.\nThis is the season to layer up, meaning that you can still wear your warm-weather clothes like short-sleeved dresses and tops with long-sleeved turtleneck tops and stockings underneath.

        "text": "The weather is biting cold as we drive on a dusty road past Chaka market in Kieni to Catch Farm in Kairi village, Kabaru in Nyeri County.\nThe farm is located a kilometre-and-a-half from the Mt Kenya Forest, which offers a serene environment that supports farming ventures.\nWe arrive at the farm about 20 minutes later. Onesmus Githui, the owner, is clad in a white overcoat and a matching cap.\nThe farmer keeps fish on his half acre, which hosts 19 ponds in greenhouses.\n\"I rear the fish in greenhouses of various sizes, the smallest measuring 6 by 7m and the biggest 10 by 30m, because of the cold weather. Inside the greenhouses, my fish are able to multiply and grow faster enabling me to meet the growing demand,\" offers Githui.\nThe retired Telecom Kenya employee ventured into fish farming in December 2010, three years after he had retired and injected in the business Sh20,000.\nThat time, his aim was to sell mature fish but he found the going tough since not many people then in the area ate the food. He diversified into fingerlings.\nTo start, he dug six ponds and bought a breeding stock of 200 male and female tilapia fish at Sh300 each.\n\"The ponds did not require dam liners because the area has clay soil which retains water. The fish bred after about two months enabling me to sell them and fingerlings to farmers and make Sh30,000 in my first harvest.\"\nThe farmer has since expanded his business, and today, he is rearing over 35,000 fish in the ponds, excluding fingerlings.\nHe farms tilapia and catfish, which he rears separately. However, he prefers tilapia because they multiply faster ensuring he has enough fingerlings and they have good market.\nAccording to Githui, catfish requires a lot of food and are not prolific breeders.\n\"To rear the fish, I also need to use pond liners for easy harvesting because when kept in earthen ponds, they hide under the mud making the harvesting difficult.\"\nHe added that catfish further need artificial propagation to enhance their reproduction.\n\"I have to remove the pituitary gland from the male fish, grind and mix it with a hormone. I then take the mixture and inject into the female catfish and put it in a cage for a minimum of 12 hours.\"\nHe then harvests the eggs by pressing the abdomen of the female fish from the pectoral fin towards the genital papilla and puts them in a container hosting semen extracted from the male fish.\n\"The mixing allows the semen to fertilise all the eggs. We then put the mixture in a temporary incubator made of polythene bag, a net, wood and water.\"\nThe eggs later hatch and he stores them in a shallow pond ready for sale.\nFor tilapia, he does not need to go through the process. They are able to multiply on their own enabling him to have at least 2,000 fingerings for sale every month.\nHe feeds the fish on fishmeal, pollard, wheat or rice bran, canola waste, sunflower and cottonseed, which he mixes to make dough.\nFor the catfish, he occasionally feeds them with crushed meat because they are carnivorous. This prevents them from feeding on their young ones.\nHe feeds the fish twice a day, at 11am and 3pm.\n\"I also insert a sack of animal manure into the ponds after every two months to help in the growth of planktons, which make the best food for fish,\" says the farmer who mainly sells fingerlings.\nSometimes he adds inorganic fertiliser; mostly DAP to increase fertility in the ponds.\nGithui attracts customers from Laikipia, Nyeri, Kiambu and Nyandarua counties where he has been supplying fingerlings and fish. John Ngiri, a lecturer at the Department of Fisheries, Kenya Wildlife Service Training School in Naivasha, says in areas with low temperatures like those around Mt Kenya, greenhouse fish farming is recommended.\n\"The greenhouse helps to increase the temperatures and enhances faster growth of fish enabling them to attain the requisite weight for selling.\"\nHe adds that organic manure especially that from chicken helps to enhance production of algae, which is good fish food and turns the water green, protecting the fish from predators.\nIrvine Ong'amo from the Naivasha Fisheries Department says farmers practising artificial propagation of catfish can also keep the male and the female in the same cage after injecting the female with a hormone for production.\nGithui sells the fingerlings at Sh15 each. He supplies between 2,000 and 3,000 a month.",

However, the President arrived about an hour later, forcing the programme to be cut short.\nThe event's main singing band, the Maroon Commandos - a military band belonging to 7th Kenya Rifles of the Kenya Army- was called upon on several occasions to play more songs to keep guests busy as they waited for the President, who arrived in the accompany of his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni.\nUpon arrival at the presidential dais, after inspecting the guard of honour, President Kenyatta, escorted by Chief of Defence Forces Samson Mwathethe, marched straight to the high table. He greeted everyone on the front row except his wife, Margaret. And the crowd noticed and appeared to ask him to shake her hand, which he did, to the amusement of the visitors, before he sat down.\nIt was Gen Mwathethe's first parade with the Head of State after taking over from his predecessor, Julius Karangi.\nAt 12.50pm, Deputy President William Ruto took over the programme and told the crowd \"good morning\", to the amazement of some visitors who noted that it was already afternoon.\nNairobi Governor Evans Kidero was not spared the missteps either when he said the Constitution was promulgated \"two years ago\". The supreme law was passed in August, 2010, that is about five years ago.\nAnd this time round, Kiswahili failed President Museveni, who claims prowess in the language. He seemed to struggle and on several occasions kept on asking those on the dais the names of simple things such as the toe and jiggers.\nAnd the high table did not disappoint the Ugandan leader - the answers were provided and he managed to give his speech in Kiswahili as he had done in the past. President Museveni said Al-Shabaab were like jiggers who required a needle to pluck them out without amputating the leg. He, however, did not mention the ICC, which was a key subject at past events.\nAt the entrance to the stadium, security officers thoroughly frisked anyone, checking everything in the pockets and bags.\nA security plane hovered around the stadium and made several fly-pasts over it as the President read his speech.\nSouth African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa made an apology for the recent xenophobic attacks in his country, which was received by fair claps.\nAbout a third of the stadium was filled by pupils from schools in Nairobi and a huge crowd of youths from Nairobi slums that wore National Youth Service branded T-shirts.\nThe youth and pupils had been mobilised by the ministries of Education and Devolution.\nVarious groups entertained the visitors after the stadium march by security officers although others were locked out as the rain threatened to pour.",

        "text": "Unrelenting rise in food and fuel prices since January has raised the possibility of higher inflation levels putting a damper on the government's efforts to lower the cost of living.\nThe prices of key food items such as maize flour and milk have been increasing mainly driven by effects of dry weather while rising oil charges are hampering efforts to further cut inflation levels.\nFarmers in Mau Narok, for example, have seen a rise in prices of their produce due to high demand against the backdrop of scarcity. According to players in the market, a 50 kilogramme bag of potatoes is selling at Sh2,000 compared to Sh800 in December.\nThe price of cabbages has also risen from Sh40 to Sh50 a piece while peas have realised the highest increase in recent weeks from Sh21 per kilogramme to Sh100. Food items contribute a significant part in determining the overall inflation rate.\nDRY WEATHER\n\"We have experienced a general increase in prices of farm produce mainly due to dry weather. The onset of rains delayed and it is only recently that some showers have been experienced. Brokers who buy from farms have been paying farmers more to cover for the orders they have as there is scarcity of most products,\" Mr Ephraim Mwangi, a dealer said.\nSome farmers and government officials, however, partly attribute the increase in prices to market distortions by traders.\nAgriculture Principal Secretary, Ms Sicily Kariuki, has said there is no reason for an increase in maize flour prices at a time when farmers are lobbying to deliver more to the National Cereals and Produce Board as strategic reserves.\nEconomic experts have pointed out that the prices increases could lead to higher inflation levels in the coming months.\n\"The key risk of the lower outlook of inflation lies on the food component which is dependent on weather patterns and any rebound of global oil prices that would have an effect on local fuel pump prices,\" Ms Maureen Kirigua, an analyst at Sterling Capital noted in a March 2015 report.\n\"We anticipate inflation figures to remain within the single digit realm in 2015,\" she said.\nOVERALL INFLATION\nPersistent drought experienced over the period pushed up the cost of living during the time to a five-month high raising concern that further rises could depress efforts to bring down interest rates.\n\"Consumer Price Indices by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics have increased by 1.12 per cent from 154.14 in February to 155.86 in March. The overall inflation rate stood at 6.31 per cent in March compared to 5.61 per cent in February.\nThis increase was mainly attributed to increase in food prices due to dry weather conditions experienced in February and March,\" AIB Capital said in a report.\nThe price of vegetables, milk and other food products registered the highest rise of 2.65 per cent in March compared to a previous month due to a delay in onset of rains.\n\"The rise in prices was mainly as a result of the dry weather conditions experienced during the period,\" KNBS director general Zachary Mwangi said in a statement.",

Prediction of drought can assist farmers in planning well in advance and to put in place strategies to maximise utilisation and minimise losses of already scarce feeds.\nIt is unacceptable to let animals starve to death, if in doubt of your capacity to take care of them through drought the best strategy is to sell them when they are still in good body condition.\nSupplemental feeding regimes\nSupplemental feeding is done in an attempt to maintain production rate by the gap left by reduced pasture availability.\nAnimal feeds conserved as either silage or fodder finds great use during drought. Because it is a time of scarcity feed saving measures must be observed at all times, hay is thus better served on hay feeders to avoid wastage.\nMolasses is a good source of energy during drought; it has an added advantage of increasing palatability of feeds.\nIn prolonged drought conditions animals should be given Vitamin A, selenium, copper, calcium and phosphorus supplements as dry feeds contain little of these essential minerals.\nIn addition, drought affected forages are often deficient in energy and protein, a reason you should consider supplementation with concentrates.\nTo further assist the animal to conserve energy, reduce the distance they have to cover to get the feeds.",

        "text": "Unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change, which have resulted in the current rainfalls and floods, have also led to an increase of diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera and typhoid.\nSince December 2014 when a cholera outbreak was reported in Nairobi County, there have been reported outbreaks across 30 of the country's 47 counties.\nThe most recent outbreak has been in Tana River and Mandera counties, where medics are working around the clock to save lives.\nIt is believed that, in Mandera County, 14 people have died between April and May this year and 894 cases have so far been reported.\nDr Mohan Lumba, Kenya Paediatric Research Consortium Chairman, says even though the disease can become endemic very fast, it is also east to treat and prevent.\n\"If you notice symptoms such as vomiting, severe and watery diarrhoea, stomach cramps and dehydration seek immediate medical help,\" he says.\nMedics says cholera is spread through food but mainly through water that has been contaminated with the stool of an infected person. So, when it rains and floods, this waterborne disease can spread like wild fire especially in regions that have poor sanitation.\nAccording to Dr Lumba, while antibiotics can be administered to the afflicted, prevention through vaccination is a better option since it helps to control spread of the disease.\nOn the other hand, when it comes to typhoid - symptoms are pretty much the same as cholera's, but in addition a person will also have an exceptionally high fever.\nRecords from the Ministry of Health and Kemri show that typhoid infects between seven to ten per cent of the population. It also kills a significant number of its victims if prevention and prompt treatment is not undertaken in time.\nDr Charles Chunge, Chairman of Centre for Tropical and Travel Diseases, says typhoid - which is spread through eating and drinking contaminated food items - kills about 30,000 people annually.\n\"The highest risk group are food handlers at kiosks, restaurants and hotels, slums dwellers, beach settlers, fishermen and school children. Also those whose immune systems have been compromised by viral and chronic diseases such as HIV/Aids and diabetes,\" he said.",

Known as - HomeSmart, the product of Azuri Technologies Limited 'learns' from a customer's usage patterns to adjust optimise its performance.\n\"There is continued growth in off-grid markets for 'smart' products that are simple, affordable and reliable. HomeSmart is the latest step in our 'Designed for Life' solutions specifically aimed at today's rural consumer,\" Azuri's CEO Simon Bransfield-Garth said.\nWhile conventional solar home systems work well in sunny conditions, they often shut off early on cloudy\ndays because they run out of power.\nHomeSmart uses learning technology to monitor climatic conditions of the user's area. It also monitors historical customer usage patterns to ensure a full night of light, even during cloudy days.\nThe new system actively monitors customer usage to determine a typical expected performance. By accurately monitoring the climatic conditions, the system automatically adjusts the light brightness to meet the user's expected lighting duration.\nThis active optimisation of light brightness, battery charging and load conditions ensures the system delivers the best possible match to the customer's typical daily requirement with available power.\nThis is believed to be the first time that such machine-learning approaches have been used in\nsmall domestic solar home systems and marks the next step in intelligent automation.\nAccording to Azuri, the user no longer has to second--guess how much sunlight there has been or how\nmuch the lights have been running as their system itself can be relied up to deliver the optimal performance.\nAzuri, whose origins are in Cambridge, the United Kingdom, operates in 12 countries where rural customers get access to renewable power through a pay-as-you-go initiative called PayGo. It has offices in Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia and Tanzania.",

        "text": "As they struggle to deal with more extreme weather, a range of food crops are generating more of chemical compounds that can cause health problems for people and livestock who eat them, scientists have warned.\nA new report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) says that crops such as wheat and maize are generating more potential toxins as a reaction to protect themselves from extreme weather.\nBut these chemical compounds are harmful to people and animals if consumed for a prolonged period of time, according to a report released during a United Nations Environment Assembly meeting in Nairobi.\n\"Crops are responding to drought conditions and increases in temperature just like humans do when faced with a stressful situation,\" explained Jacqueline McGlade, chief scientist and director of the Division of Early Warning and Assessment at UNEP.\nUnder normal conditions, for instance, plants convert nitrates they absorb into nutritious amino acids and proteins. But prolonged drought slows or prevents this conversion, leading to more potentially problematic nitrate accumulating in the plant, the report said.\nIf people eat too much nitrate in their diets, it can interfere with the ability of red blood cells to transport oxygen in the body, the report said.\nCrops susceptible to accumulating too much nitrate in times of stress include maize, wheat, barley, soybeans, millet and sorghum, it said.\nDROUGHT, THEN RAIN\nSome drought-stressed crops, when then exposed to sudden large amounts of rain that lead to rapid growth, in turn accumulate hydrogen cyanide, more commonly known as prussic acid, the report said.\nPrussic acid - one of the ingredients used in some types of chemical warfare - interferes with oxygen flow in humans. Even short-term exposure can be debilitating for people, McGlade said.\nPlants such as cassava, flax, maize and sorghum are most vulnerable to dangerous prussic acid accumulation, the report said.\nCases of nitrate or hydrogen cyanide poisoning in humans were reported in Kenya in 2013 and in the Philippines in 2005, McGlade said. In Kenya, two children died in coastal Kilifi after eating cassava that had raised levels of prussic acid in it following extreme rainfall, according to local media reports.",

        "text": "Last week, two great ecological stories were reported from two contrasting ends of the earth. The first one came from Venezuela, the South American country just North of Brazil, currently experiencing severe drought.\nAccording to media reports, the prolonged drought is so bad that President Nicolas Maduro announced a two-day work week so as to conserve the little energy due to low water levels in the main dam. Water levels at the country's Guri Dam, one of the world's largest hydroelectric facilities, reached a record 793 feet. The drought is the worst in 47 years.\n\"We are going to have Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays as non-working days for the public sector,\" President Maduro said in a televised address.\nThe other story was in Kenya. Here, the situation was completely different. The whole of last week witnessed a trail of destruction in the wake ongoing torrential rains. Images of flooded streets, people wading through neck-deep waters, collapsing walls and landslides were the order of the day.\nThe most tragic event, however, was the collapse of a building in Nairobi's Huruma estate that has left scores of people dead. In both cases, the El-Nino phenomenon was said to be the main cause. El-Nino is a disruption in global weather patterns in the tropics, including Kenya. It results in extreme weather and climatic conditions such as drought, flood, cold and hot spells. Adverse socio-economic impacts include loss of life, destruction to property, water shortage, energy, food and other basic necessities.\nThe unusual weather pattern has always been with us but lack of preparedness has led to the negative effects such as those witnessed in both Kenya and Venezuela.\nAs far back as last year, the local meteorological department warned that enhanced rains would continue. According to the department, current projections from global models indicated there was an 80 per cent chance that current El-Nino conditions would extend to the early parts of 2016.\nIn fact, the deputy director of the Kenya Meteorological Department Peter Ambenje even talked of the advantages of the heavy rains: \"The positive side of it is water dams filling up, pasture regenerating, sufficient water for hydro-electric power generation, plenty of rain water to harvest, good performance of crops in various parts such as the southeastern lowlands among others.\"\nHowever, as the two experiences show, we have learnt little on how to harness natural resources for our benefit.",

OPEC's report said that \"positive market sentiments continue to arise\" from the freeze plan.\nThe group's data shows that the 11 OPEC members who are confirmed to attend the Doha talks are pumping 487,000 barrels a day below January levels, the benchmark proposed for the freeze deal. Libya has said it won't attend the meeting, and Iran has yet to decide. Saudi Arabia's output has remained stable since January, the report showed.\nAll 13 members pumped 32.25 million barrels a day in March, up 14,900 a day from February, according to external estimates compiled by Opec.\nGlobal oil demand will average 94.18 million barrels a day in 2016, according to the report. This year's growth rate of 1.2 million barrels a day is down from 1.54 million a day in 2015 amid a slowdown in consumption of industrial fuels and middle distillates in China and Latin America.",

        "text": "Capsicums or pilipili hoho are a hardy plant. All they require is a slightly warmer temperatures than tomatoes or cucumbers.\nIt is rarely attacked by diseases or pests though it still needs proper preventive care. Plants are retarded by cool weather as they tend to harden and seldom regain the vigorous growth necessary for high yields. In cold weather, the fruit remains small, hard and malformed because of uneven pollination. The fruit may also have numerous growth cracks.\nVarieties\nMost commercial varieties are hybrids. These varieties have a primary mature colour that is usually green, but may be yellow. They also have a secondary mature colour that is usually red, but may be orange or yellow or other colours. Fruit picked at this stage is much sweeter than green fruit and has more pro-vitamin A. There are also black, cream, and brown and lime coloured varieties.\nNew varieties are always being introduced, so check with your local seed supplier or nearest agricultural extension officer.\nThese varieties may be more resistant to disease, produce higher yields of fruit, produce more uniform fruit or be more suited to the latest market requirements for quality. Before planting new varieties on a large scale, compare them in small plantings to existing varieties under the same growing conditions.\nCrop establishment\nPlanting starts from the nursery. You can make sunken or raised nurseries although most farmers prefer sunken nurseries because they retain water more than raised nurseries. Add small amounts of animal/compost manure this will ensure strong and healthy seedlings.\nEnsure the distance between the rows is about 1.5 inches to give room for easy management.\nAfter sowing the seeds, it will take about two to three weeks for them to germinate. Capsicums seedlings will be ready for transplanting within sixweeks.\nTransplanting\nUnprotected crops make slow early growth and harvesting is often delayed. Low plastic tunnels or cloches aid the production of early crops. Harden the capsicum seedlings by reducing frequency of watering gradually one week before transplanting, don't do it abruptly. On the day of transplanting, wet the nursery enough to allow easy uprooting of the seedling from the nursery without damaging the roots.",

These are blessings that have come with the Pope and I could not miss the opportunity hence I had to make sure my whole family is here to witness. We were here by 6 am,\" said Mary Syongo from Machakos who was accompanied by her husband and three children.\nAnother faithful Monica Kiilu was ecstatic to attend the mass. \"This is the second mass I am attending officiated by a Pope that is why I had to tag my son along with me for him to treasure this memory.\"\nHowever, many preferred that the mass would have been held at Uhuru Park in order to attract larger crowds. \"We know security is what warranted the mass to be held in UoN but Uhuru Park is still an ideal venue,\" said Chris Mutiso.\nDespite not being in church or at the main venue, faithfuls still followed the Catholics traditions to the latter. When the congregation at UoN was instructed to stand up for prayers, the crowds at Central and Uhuru Park followed suit.\nThis happened religiously even before the translator could interpret in English what the Pope had instructed in Italian. Despite the language barrier, concentration was extremely high when the Pope was speaking a testimony that in the spiritual realm, there is only one language.",

        "text": "Farmers across the country will soon benefit from an ambitious plan by the Government and private sector to insure their crops and livestock.\nThe plan, which was unveiled Wednesday, will cover small-scale farmers against weather-related crop failure and loss of livestock. It is a move geared towards aiding farmers mitigate or adapt to effects of prolonged drought and other weather related phenomena, including El Nino.\nAgriculture, Livestock and Fisheries acting Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohammed said this in Nairobi during the launch of the Tegemeo Agriculture conference.\n\"The three issues of climatic change, devolution and limited land sizes greatly influence the ability of households to improve incomes and meet their food and nutrition security needs. As a Government we continue to put in place strategies and programmes that will improve livelihoods of Kenyans facing these issues,\" Mr Mohammed said.\nThe meeting was attended by the director of USAid mission in Kenya Karen Freeman and Egerton University Vice Chancellor James Tuitoek among others. Mohammed also confirmed that the Government was seeking to increase its spending in agriculture to 10 per cent of its annual budget, focusing mainly on expanding irrigated land and improving rural infrastructure.\nHe, however, noted that the declining land per capita due to the increasing Kenyan population posed a challenge to the agricultural sector, which was projected to grow by at least 10 per cent annually consequently lifting Kenya to a middle-income country by 2030.\n\"This trend in land sizes coupled with cases of arable land put under non-agricultural uses will continue to hamper growth in the economy. To achieve the requisite growth, smallholder production needs to transform to cope with changing production and marketing environments,\" he observed.\nOn climate change, he noted that irregular rain patterns had led to a rise in temperature, leading to frequent and prolonged droughts. He said the status quo would remain unless something was done.\n\"Given its reliance on weather, agricultural production will bear the brunt of climatic variability and change. This calls for adoption of strategies to enhance resilience of the farmers and ensure that they engage in agricultural activities that sustain the environment and improve their incomes,\" Mohammed said.\nOther measures that the Government has put in place include provision of relief food and emergency supplies and provision of drought resistance seeds and seedlings.\nThe Tegemeo conference is in line with the Agricultural Sector Development Strategy and also captures the aspirations of the National Climatic Change Response Strategy and the National Climate Change Action Plan (2013-2017).",

        "text": "World food prices rose in October, spurred by weather-driven concerns about sugar and palm oil supplies, but remained well below their equivalent level a year ago, the United Nations food agency said yesterday.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy, meat and sugar, averaged 162 points in October against 155.9 the month before. FAO said this was the sharpest increase since July 2012, although food on international markets in October was still 16 per cent cheaper than a year earlier.\nThe FAO's sugar price index led the rise, jumping 17.2 per cent from September because of fears of heavy rains in the main sugar-growing regions of Brazil. The vegetable oil price index rose 6.2 per cent, partly on worries the El Nino weather phenomenon would hit Indonesian palm oil supplies in 2016. The FAO cut its forecast for world cereal output in 2015 to 2.530 billion tonnes - some 1.1 per cent below last year's record - from a previous estimate of 2.534 billion tonnes given last month.",

        "text": "At a sleepy and dusty village in Kitui County, a group of farmers have successfully kicked poverty out of their homesteads by keeping Togenberg breed of goats, which are famed for their milk production and good prices in the market.\nNzeluni Farm Dairy Goat Self Help Group has 18 members who have become role models for their efforts. The group trades under Kitui/Mwingi Goat Breeders Association, an umbrella body of 42 farmers' groups spread across Mwingi Central, Ngomeni, Nuu, Kitui Central and Chuluni divisions.\nMr Munuve Mutemi, a member of the group, is the association's chairman. He says so far, they have 1,000 members, 600 of them being women. The association has slightly over 2,000 goats, which have improved the livelihoods of the members.\n\"We started in 2005 organised by Farm Africa which identified poor people in the community and donated the goats. Since then, we have never looked back,\" says Mutemi.\nEach group has a 'buck station' and 'breeding station'. The 'buck station' is like the factory of the group. Here, a pure gigantic Togenberg goat, is kept purposely to mount female goats. It feeds strictly under zero grazing and is only unleashed when a female goat is brought for mating.\n\"The he goat is used to cross breed indigenous goats of both group members and non-members. It is also used to upgrade the crosses so that we get an almost pure Togenberg breed,\" explains Mutemi.\nCross-breeds\nThrough cross breeding, the farmers can now get between three to four litres of milk per day per goat compared to half a litre produced by the indigenous goats. The farmers sell the milk at between Sh80 and 100 per litre in schools, homesteads and hotels.\nHowever, the farmers fetch good returns from selling the cross breeds.\nMutemi says a first generation cross breed of seven months is sold at Sh10,000 while a second generation cross breed fetches Sh15,000.\nMr Mutemi, who doubles up as the group's veterinary officer, says they aim at second generation cross breeds with 75 per cent genetic traits of the hybrid and 25 per cent of the indigenous. This is to ensure the animals can withstand the harsh climatic conditions in the county and are resistant to diseases.\nTo avoid inbreeding, Mutemi says they do 'buck movement' whereby the he goat is transferred to another group after one and a half years. \"This prevents kids being born with disabilities or being of poor health,\" he says.",

However, the effectiveness of their emergency preparedness and mitigating measures will be put to test when the actual event occurs.\nAs a country we can't afford to be complacent.

        "text": "Waking up one chilly Sunday morning, the cold weather engulfed Nairobi, resulting in people bundling up to keep warm.\nFrom their stiff walking styles and layered dressing, it was clear the temperatures were not favourable.\nMany people tried hard to keep themselves warm.\nSome used heaters and others jikos (charcoal stoves) to keep the cold away.\nI went to church and came back home. I could not understand why it was so chilly on this day. I layered several items of clothing to keep warm including socks and gloves, but still, I was chilled to the bone.\nHowever, since I use a jiko to boil certain foods that cannot be cooked on gas, I resorted to lighting a jiko, normally used to cook certain foods that would only use a lot of gas due to duration of cooking.\nTHE CALM BEFORE THE STORM\nI placed the jiko in the middle of my sitting room. It brought much-needed warmth as the charcoal was fully burning. I went to the kitchen and made myself some popcorn and settled in to watch my favourite soap opera, Mucha Italiana.\nI was so engrossed that I forgot about the cold weather. As the soap opera came to an end, I realised the fire was dwindling, so I went back to the kitchen and refilled the jiko with charcoal, before bringing it back to the sitting room.\nAt around 10pm, I felt sleepy but as my usual, routine, I had to watch another soap opera Unforgivable. I struggled not to fall asleep and succeeded until the episode was over and even had time to make my hair. Afterwards, I carried the jiko and took it outside on to the balcony, then proceeded to shut all the windows and lock the doors before going to bed.\nTHE UNENDING HEADACHE\nSuddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my head and I could not understand why. However, I continued to get ready for bed despite the headache. After a while, I thought it was dissipate but it didnt. I even undid my hair thinking maybe it was too tight and was causing the headache. I waited. Still no improvement. I left my fate to God because I was not a fan of drugs.\nOn Monday morning, I woke up at 6.45am, ready to go to work, but I could not even move a leg. I pushed myself to go to work since it was my shift and had no alternative to stand in for me in the office. When I reached the office, my vision became blurred, I felt weak and felt like my head was literally splitting into two from the severe throbbing. I consumed litres of water since I thought it was dehydration, but the headache would not go away.\nAt 2pm, the headache reduced and I later left for home. On getting there, I was astonished to hear my family members complaining of the same headache. It then hit me that the cause must have been the jiko that we had used to keep warm on Sunday night.\nCoincidentally, The Star had that Monday carried a story on the effects of carbon monoxide (CO) touching on two men who had died after inhaling CO when they tried to keep warm in Karen, Nairobi. I then googled and realised that we were lucky because, if we had slept longer that morning, I would not be alive to write this story. Nobody knew about the effects of carbon monoxide (CO), yet as a journalist, we write stories of people dying daily because of the poisonous gas.\nI wanted to share my story so that people become more aware of the inherent danger of inhaling CO especially through jikos, a common sight in many households.\nSYMPTOMS OF CARBON MONOXIDE INTOXICATION:\n-Breathing the gas can cause headache, dizziness, vomiting, and nausea.\n-If the gas level is high enough, you may become unconscious or die.\n-Exposure to moderate and high levels of CO over long periods of time has also been linked with increased risk of heart disease.\nMost people have experienced some of these symptoms at one time or another, but it does not necessarily mean that the CO poisoning caused them.\nHowever, regular occurrence of any of these symptoms might be an indication of carbon monoxide.\nIf you realise CO has infiltrated your system, doctors advise that you turn off the source of CO or, in my case, extinguish the jiko. Then move to places with fresh air circulation, that is , near a window or open door.\nIf indoors, move outside to fresh air immediately, and if outdoors, move far away from the source of CO.",

Of course, the Huruma building collapse was still fresh in my mind and I cannot help feeling it is a precursor or a harbinger. Did you know the name 'Nairobi' comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to \"cool water?''\nThe phrase is also the Maasai name of the Nairobi River, which in turn lent its name to the city. The area was essentially uninhabited swamp until a supply depot of the Uganda Railway was built in 1899. I have always said to Nishet, we have built on rivers and if rainfall spikes (like it is doing now), a whole lot of this city is going to be washed away and very little distinction is going to be made between Huruma, Westlands or Mzima Springs on the way to Lavington.\nOver the weekend, we also learnt five islands have disappeared in the Pacific's Solomon Islands due to rising sea levels and coastal erosion, according to an Australian study. The global warming phenomenon is real, it was kind to us in 2015, but I cannot help feeling the phenomenon is set to intensify. And the last few days are a powerful signal of where things are headed. Last year, we found ourselves in a ''sweet spot'' in the El Nino phenomenon. Whilst farmlands to our North and South were parched, Kenya sat in a ''sweet spot''.\nAgriculture constitutes 25 per cent of Kenya's GDP and the diffusion effect means when agriculture does well, there is good trickle-down. The economy expanded at a 5.6 per cent rate in 2015, according to the KNBS. \"Agriculture gross value improved to 6.2 per cent in the period under review from 3.5 per cent in 2014 due to good weather and abundant rainfall,\" said Kenya National Bureau of Statistics director general Zachary Mwangi. The governor of the Central Bank Patrick Njoroge said wistfully in a Reuters Interview in December: \"I wish I could say something about controlling the weather.\"\nThe weather is now a serious wild-card for folks who are parked on riparian land, for the farm economy and even monetary policy. The historian Sir Stephen Ranchman and was known for having \"played piano duets with the last emperor of China and twice hit the jackpot on slot machines in Las Vegas\". The last point, \"twice hit the jackpot on slot machines in Las Vegas\" are the odds, in my opinion, for another similarly benign outcome in 2016 as we had in 2015.",

As soon as the equilibrium on demand and supply changes, we are likely to see similar change on prices at points of sale,\" said John Gethi, Brookside's director of milk procurement.\nHowever, the Consumer Federation of Kenya said milk prices have remained exorbitantly high adding that the Kenya Dairy Board has failed on its regulatory role in the milk market, paving way for processors to fleece consumers.\n\"We know there is oversupply of milk now due to the heavy rains but the retail prices are still high. Our view is that the Kenya Dairy Board is part of the cartel made by processors to keep milk prices high,\" Secretary general Stephen Mutoro said on phone.\nThe country has been experiencing the El Nino since October and the heavy rains are expected to continue pounding until the end of March.\nThe wet weather basically facilitates the growth of enough pasture for cows, resulting to more milk production.\nThe Kenya Dairy Processors Association had previously said that consumers would see a slight drop in the shelf price in December.\nHowever, spot checks in the major retail outlets over the last six months indicate the price of the 500ML tetra pak has remained unchanged at an average of Sh60 while the 500ML pouch has been retailing at around Sh50.\n\"We didn't reduce the prices because the El Nino effects were not that serious between October and December,\" KDPA chairman Nixon Sigey said.\nSigey, who is also the New Kenya Cooperative Creameries managing director, said they are planning to hold a processors' meeting which will determine the possibility for a cut in milk prices.\n\"Processors are receiving a lot of milk from the farmers at the moment.

        "text": "President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday said the government has introduced a crop insurance scheme to cushion farmers from adverse weather conditions.\nUhuru said the insurance scheme is being tested in Bungoma, Nakuru and Embu counties.\n\"Indeed, a thousand farmers in these counties have already benefitted from the premium subsidy at a cost of Sh300 million,\" he said.\nHe said his administration has also introduced livestock insurance, which is being piloted in Turkana, Wajir, Marsabit, Isiolo and Tana River at a cost of Sh152 million.\n\"The results of the two pilot schemes are encouraging; ultimately we intend to roll out these schemes to every county in the country.\"\nUhuru made the announcement when he officially opened this year's Agricultural Society of Kenya Nairobi International Trade Fair at the Jamhuri Park Showground.\nTo ensure farmers have a regular water supply to increase food crops and livestock production, the President said his administration has brought new more land under irrigation and revitalised older schemes.\n\"My administration has, under the Expanded National Irrigation Program, rehabilitated and expanded national irrigation schemes by 27,000 acres between 2013 and 2015,\" he said.\nHe added: \"Indeed, in just one of those schemes, at Mwea, we are set to double the area of land under irrigation.\"\nThe President said the government has also taken a raft of other measures to ensure food security including lowering the cost of farm inputs.\nHe said his government has distributed 912,920 metric tonnes of subsidized fertiliser to 1.5 million farmers and reduced the average cost of fertiliser by half since 2013.\n\"In 2013, you paid Sh6,000 for a 50 kg bag of fertilizer; today you are paying Sh3,000. That is, without a doubt, a real improvement for you, and for Kenya,\" Uhuru said.\nIn addition, Uhuru said the government this year commissioned two fertiliser plants in Eldoret and Nakuru that together have a capacity of 500,000 tonnes.\nThe cost of fertilisers will further go down once the two plants are fully operational with the fertilisers tailored to conditions and requirements of the farmers.\nAs part of the Jubilee Administration's effort to revitalize coffee production and exports, the President said the Government has allowed a debt waiver of Sh9.5 billion.\nHe said his administration has also developed the Kenya Coffee mark of origin to improve the country's brand visibility.\n\"Equally, we have abolished the 4 per cent ad valorem levy, and established the Commodities Fund, which has supported 100,000 coffee farmers with a total of Sh2.6 billion,\" the President said.\nTo support dairy farming, Uhuru said the Jubilee Government has installed 48 milk coolers nationally for improved milk marketing at a cost of Sh350 million.\n\"To be clear: it is an investment we have undertaken because we recognize the wonderful work that our dairy farmers are doing,\" he said.\nOther measures taken to enhance livestock production include setting up a new Sh400 million artificial insemination station in Kitale and the introduction of oil-based vaccines at a cost of Sh217 million.\nThese are more potent than the water-based vaccines livestock farmers were using in the past.\nTo ensure fully exploitation of Kenya's marine wealth potential, the President affirmed that his administration has put in place a range of programs to revitalise the blue economy including reflagging an additional fishing vessel in the Indian Ocean.\n\"Equally, we are in the process of procuring an offshore patrol vessel, at a cost of Sh3,715 million, to patrol the exclusive economic zone,\" Uhuru said.\nIn addition, the President pointed out that the Fisheries Management and Development Act 2016 has been enacted.\nThe law will strengthen the governing of the fisheries industry and help us to stop illegal and unregulated fishing.\n\"As a country, it is estimated that we have been losing revenue every year to the tune of Sh10 billion,\" he noted.\nHe said the government has also restocked Tana River dams, Lake Naivasha and Lake Jipe, leading to an increase of 1,300 metric tonnes of fish caught.\nOther speakers included Agriculture CS Willy Bett, Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and Agricultural Society of Kenya National Chairperson Annabella Kiriinya.",

        "text": "After weathering turbulence, Jubilee Party is strapped in for first-class takeoff on Saturday, unveiling its eight-story, high-security headquarters in Pangani and ensuring all systems are go.\nThe three-day launch from Thursday through Saturday, involving more than 123,000 delegates has been reported to cost at least Sh2 billion. Insiders scoff, calling the figure too high, without elaborating.\nThere will be a drama of defections from the opposition:\nYesterday, National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale disclosed that five governors and more than 35 Cord MPs will defect to the Jubilee Party on Saturday during the National Delegates Conference at Kasarani.\nSpeaking at Parliament Buildings, Duale said JP will welcome Governors Salim Mvurya (ODM Kwale), Hussein Dado, (Wiper Tana River), Issa Timamy (UDF Lamu), Simon Kachapin, (Kanu West Pokot) and Ukur Yatani (ODM (Marsabit).\nDuale said 35 MPs and senators from Cord affiliates will defect on the same day.\n\"We expect a number of our brothers and sisters from Coast, Kisii and parts of Western regions to join us. Our essence is to make sure that jubilee is a party for all Kenyans,\" he said.\nExpert comment: Jubilee's grand scheme of political inclusion is shaping up\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta will be setting the tone for his re-election campaign as he launches the mega party at Kasarani. It is to be an amalgamation of 13 affiliate outfits.\nHis \"Tuko Pamoja\" campaign message - branded everywhere, from buildings to 47 leased SUVs to T-shirts - emphasises the unity of Kenyans \"moving together to achieve development and transformation\".\nThe President is closely following events in the run-up to the celebration to ensure everyone and every event follow the script and echo the unity theme.\nOn Thursday, affiliate parties merging into the Jubilee Party will fold up at the Bomas of Kenya and Kasarani Stadium.\nMerger issues have arisen with Ford People and the Party of National Unity (PNU). Parties also had been squabbling over numbers of attending delegates who will decide the 21 powerful interim JP officials. However, major problems appear to have been resolved.\nOn Friday, delegates from various parties will ratify the instruments of the new party at Kasarani.\nDeputy President William Ruto will be the keynote speaker.\nThe President is expected to visit JP headquarters in Pangani area on Thika road on Friday, before attending a dress rehearsal at Kasarani.\nIn 2012, on the eve of TNA's launch, the President visited the KICC venue where he tested the teleprompter and public address system.\nYesterday Uhuru's speech writers were busy crafting the message. The first draft was expected on his desk last night.\n\"In 2012, the President asked Kenyans to believe in him and his party TNA. On joining up with DP Ruto, they promised Kusema and Kutenda. Tuko Pamoja signifies not only unity but also that we are still walking together on this journey to transform Kenya. This is the message we will be echoing,\" a highly placed Jubilee source said.\nSince Sunday night, party enthusiasts have widely shared on social media the new party headquarters, as well as 47 mostly red Toyota Prado vehicles branded with the party colours and logo. That's just half the fleet; the rest is expected by the end of the year.\nThe Star has established party sponsors already have paid half the rent for the headquarters' five-year lease.\nContractors have been working overtime to furnish the building and instal security. It will be the nerve centre for Uhuru's 2017 campaign and party business.\nStaff based at the Thika Road campaign headquarters include political strategists, data analysts, researchers and call centre staff providing real-time updates to State House and supporters.\nA strict set of security protocols are in place because of the sensitive information flowing through the centre.\nThe building will contain one of the three national tally centres Uhuru and his team will use to returns next year.\nThe show of might is nothing new for Uhuru and follows his 2013 campaign when the Jubilee coalition spent billions of shillings. It used more than 30, four-wheel drive vehicles and six choppers branded in TNA and Ruto's URP colours.\nIt is estimated Jubilee spent Sh200 million to launch the coalition at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru in 2012 and its manifesto in Nairobi in 2013.\nProposed interim officials\nEven as the party puts together an elaborate launch plan, releases details and shows off its headquarters, the list of 21 JP interim officials is a closely guarded secret.\nInsiders say secrecy is necessary to avoid fallout if affiliate parties feel shortchanged by the dominant two outfits - TNA and URP.\nThe JP steering committee has presented the Uhuru and Ruto a list of proposed officials, with its co-chairman Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi, the interim chairman.\nHe is to be deputised by his co-chair on the steering committee, former minister Noah Wekesa, Taita Taveta MP Naomi Shabaan and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen.\nNominated MP and TNA chairman Johnson Sakaja is proposed for interim secretary general.\nProposed as his deputies are Kilifi MP Gideon Mung'aro, nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi and TNA secretary General Onyango Oloo.\nThe Star has also learnt Mukurwe-Ini MP Kabando wa Kabando has been proposed as organising secretary. He is to be deputised by UDF chairman Hassan Osman.\nFafi MP Bare Shill is proposed for treasurer, with Mumias MP Ben Washiali the deputy Treasurer.",

        "text": "Kenya's biggest lender by assets, the Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), has shrugged off risk concerns to allocate Sh35 billion ($350 million) of its credit portfolio to finance agricultural ventures.\nThe allocation was announced in Nairobi yesterday at the ongoing Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa (Agra) forum in a move aimed at pulling other financial institutions to put money in the sector which accounts for one quarter of GDP.\nTerms for the KCB loans were not immediately made public. Banks have long considered the weather-dependent farming among the riskiest undertakings.\nCentral Bank of Kenya data shows that just 4.04 per cent of the Sh2.165 trillion loans disbursed in 2015 benefited farming ventures. According to a study by the Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSD Kenya), financing agriculture that would otherwise provide more income-earning opportunities for the poor has reduced.\n\"Lending to agriculture (the main livelihood source for the poor) has actually reduced. Official data on poverty levels will not be available until 2016 but there is little to indicate that a major, positive shift has taken place,\" FSD said.\nREAD: Banks to raise credit allocation for Agriculture\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta asked African governments and the private sector to invest massively in agriculture if Africa is to make meaningful progress.\n\"We all committed to the goal of increasing financing for agriculture. Today, let us make that commitment specific. I propose we pledge to mobilise at least $400 billion of public and private sector investment over the next five years. With goodwill and partnership, this is more than possible,\" President Kenyatta said.\nGain access to markets\nThe Kenyan head of state announced that his government was committed to spending Sh20 billion to support 150,000 young farmers and agriculture entrepreneurs.\nThe money will go into helping young farmers gain access to markets, finance and insurance, improving access to modern machinery and other agriculture technology and increasing value addition and agro-processing in Kenya.\nThe third day of Agra forum saw African Development Bank (AfDB) pledge Sh240 billion ($2.4 billion) each year under the Feed Africa programme for the next 10 years which translates to Sh240 billion.\nThe AfDB has previously been allocating $600 million (Sh60 billion) for agricultural financing. Other pledges were made by Econet Wireless chairman Strive Masiyiwa who intends to invest Sh3.5 trillion ($35 billion) and the Rockefeller Foundation which pledged Sh18 billion.\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations committed Sh500 billion ($5 billion), the World Food Program (WFP) said it would set aside Sh12 billion ($120 million) to cater for countries including Kenya while OCP Africa pledged Sh3 billion ($30 million).\nRockefeller Foundation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also gave a pledge to fund the operational cost of the African Green Revolution Forum for the next five years.",

        "text": "Drought-stricken residents of Tana-River and Kilifi counties on Friday received 62,000 bags of maize harvested from the Galana-Kulalu Irrigation Project.\nIn what is seen as the Government's effort to demonstrate viability of the project, Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and his counterpart for Devolution and Special Programmes Mwangi Kiunjuri flagged off two trucks carrying the maize to Ganze in Kilifi County.\n\"Today as a line ministry we are happy that after years of research, after years of developing infrastructure, we can actually say something good has come out of Galana,\" said Mr Wamalwa at the event that was also attended by Tana River Governor Hussein Dado.\nThe 62,000 bags of maize were harvested from a 2,500-acre model farm in the irrigation project.\nThe Government plans to scale up the project to 10,000 acres, with yields expected to rise from the current 31 bags per acre to 40 bags per acre.\nThe increased yields are as a result of four varieties of maize, which experts say have adapted well with the soil and the area's climate.\nWhen the project started, about 13 varieties were tested from which the National Irrigation Project was able to realise only 13 bags from an acre in its first pilot phase.\nApart from food, Mr Wamalwa said his ministry was also mobilising resources to get water to drought-affected areas. The drought situation is so intense that the residents of neighbouring Mombasa County on Thursday held special prayers for rain.\n\"We want to say as Government that we are not just going to wait for rains. We must develop our irrigation infrastructure,\" said Mr Wamalwa.\nNOT KNEE-JERK REACTION\nResidents of 14 arid and semiarid lands (Asals) in the country have seen almost all their livestock and crops die due to the ongoing drought.\n\"So far, we have harvested very good maize that has been tested and found to be aflatoxin-free,\" said the CS.\nAflatoxin is a class of toxic compounds that are produced by certain molds found in food.\nThree different harvests have so far been done from the Galana project, one of the major Vision 2030 initiatives.\nspeaking at the event, CS Kiunjuri dismissed claims that the distribution of the 62,000 bags of maize from the project was a knee-jerk reaction from the Government, saying it has always distributed relief food.\n\"In 2013, we used to feed 2.4 million people every month. Today, we are only feeding 1.5 million Kenyans,\" he said.\nThe Government has been forced to double its distribution of relief food from the normal 30,000 bags monthly as the hunger bites in most parts of the country.\nNIB projects to plant 2,000 acres of maize every month and intends to complete the entire 10,000 acres at Galana by September next year as the laying of water pipes and clearing of bushes have been done.\nOTHER COUNTIES\nThe plan is to increase the number of maize distributed for relief food from 62,000 to 100,000 bags.\nMr Wamalwa said after its completion, Galana will be opened up to both local and international investors.\nOther counties that have been affected by drought and which will also benefit from such irrigation projects as Galana include Pokot, Lodwar and Turkana.\nKenya for long has depended on the Rift Valley as its bread basket.",

Some can hardly walk.\nIn the last one month alone, 15 hippos have succumbed to drought and death at the lake is threatening the lives of over 40,000 residents who depend on it for food, water and income.\nBy KALUME KAZUNGU\nMore by this Author\nA wafting, pungent smell of decomposing flesh assaults nostrils more than 100 metres away.\nAn army of scavengers takes charge both in the air and on land, feasting on carcasses of hippopotamus, tortoise, slugs, fish, snail, birds and other animals.\nSwarms of flies and other insects give buzzing salutes you as you walk through the valley of death that has become the lake named after Kenya's founding President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta.\nINLETS BLOCKED\nLake Kenyatta in Mpeketoni, Lamu County, is on the verge of extinction- thanks to humans who have encroached on it and blocked almost all its inlets in the name of farming.\nAs you move closer, the silence of a cemetery fills the water body that was once characterised by chattering monkeys, chirping birds, croaking frogs, grunting warthogs, rumbling buffaloes and screaming hippos.\nDried up bones and millions of shells of dead molluscs and reptiles dot the dried-up parts of the water body that has shrunk by an estimated five kilometres.\nShells of dead tortoises and snails litter the shores of Lake Kenyatta. PHOTO | KALUME KAZUNGU | NATION MEDIA GROUP.\nBONES AND SHELLS\nIn 1980s, Lake Kenyatta was 12 kilometres in length. Today, it is less than seven kilometres long and shrinking by the day.\nThe water source located on the northern Coast of Kenya, some 230 kilometres from Malindi town and 60 kilometres from Lamu Archipelago, was also home to herds of zebra, waterbucks and unique species of wild birds.\nThis is one of the 15 hippos that have succumbed to ravages of drought at the lake. PHOTO | KALUME KAZUNGU | NATION MEDIA GROUP.\nThis life is no more.\nIn its place are bones, shells and nauseating smell-a disaster that has shocked residents, environmentalists, visitors and the Lamu county government.\n15 HIPPOS DEAD\nIn the last one month alone, 15 hippos have succumbed to drought and death at the lake is now threatening the lives of over 40,000 residents who depend on it for food, water and income.\nThe few surviving animals, fish and birds are also staring at death after the lake's water turned salty.\nSome can hardly walk.\nThe length of Lake Kenyatta has shrunk by more than five kilometres. PHOTO | KALUME KAZUNGU | NATION MEDIA GROUP.\nLake Kenyatta does not have an outlet and it mainly loses water through evaporation.\nRAVAGING DROUGHT\nSince its inlets are blocked, increased evaporation due to the drought, which has ravaged many parts of coastal Kenya, has made its water to become saline.\n\"Hippos can no longer enjoy the lake. Even fish have problems,\" says Benson Kariuki, chairman of Lake Kenyatta Water users Association- a body that controls a Sh80 million water project that supplies water to over 5,000 residents in the area.\nCarcass of yet another hippo that succumbed to drought at Lake Kenyatta. PHOTO | KALUME KAZUNGU | NATION MEDIA GROUP.\n\"We urge the national and county government to intervene and demarcate the lake and protect it.\"\nLAKE SHRINKING\nGovernor Timamy came face to face with the lake's disaster on Tuesday when he visited the area accompanied by a group of environmentalists from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).\n\"I am worried by what I have seen at Lake Kenyatta,\" he says as he shakes his head.\nThe waters of Lake Kenyatta used to fill the spot where this man is standing. The length of the water body has shrunk by more than five kilometres. PHOTO | KALUME KAZUNGU | NATION MEDIA GROUP.\n\"The lake is shrinking at an alarming rate and it is sad to see such a crucial resource on the verge of extinction.\"\nHe blames the deepening crisis on increased human settlement and crop cultivation around the lake.\nRICE FARMING\nStreams that used to feed the lake, he says, have been interfered with as locals battle to feed their bulging families.\n\"Human beings are growing rice in the water ways and wetlands, while cattle in thousands come to feed water from the lake every day,\" he explains.\nLamu county and WWF officials examine the carcass of one of the hippos that succumbed to drought. PHOTO | KALUME KAZUNGU | NATION MEDIA GROUP.\nRavaging drought has seen pastoralists from Lamu, Tana River and Garissa counties descend on the lake with flocks of their thirsty livestock.\nBesides drinking, the cattle pollute the lake and graze vegetation around the water body- creating unnecessary competition for food with wild animals.\n4M CATTLE\nAn estimated four million heads of cattle drink water from the endangered lake each year, putting additional strain on the little water left on its bed by sun rays.\nCarcass of a hippo that succumbed to drought at Lake Kenyatta. PHOTO | KALUME KAZUNGU | NATION MEDIA GROUP.\nTimamy's leadership, the WWF and Lake Kenyatta Water Users Association have started plans to save the water body from imminent extinction.\nWWF Lamu and Tana Landscape Programme Manager John Bett wants Kenya Wildlife Service to gazette the lake with a view of addressing water scarcity in Lamu and surrounding regions.\n\"We need to come together and introduce short-term measures to save the lake. There is need for the lake to be fenced so as to reduce the influx of cattle,\" he says.\nThe waters of Lake Kenyatta used to wash the foot of this watch tower. Today, they are metres away. PHOTO | KALUME KAZUNGU | NATION MEDIA GROUP.\nLAKE INVASION\nBett regrets the residents' invasion of the lake.\nA big population of Mpeketoni and Mkunubi, he says, depends on the water body for survival but little is being done to conserve it.\nOn his part, Timamy wants Kenya Wildlife Service to establish if there could be other factors killing animals in the region besides drought.",

        "text": "Kenya is among the Horn of Africa countries that are likely to see a rise in hunger and further decline of livelihoods in the coming months.\nFarming families will be struggling with the knock-on effects of multiple droughts that hit the region this year, Food and Agriculture Organisation said in an early warning brief Tuesday.\nIt said close to 12 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are currently in need of food assistance. Families face limited access to food and income, together with rising debt, low cereal and seed stocks, and low milk and meat production.\n\"Terms of trade are particularly bad for livestock farmers, as food prices are increasing. At the same time, market prices for livestock are low,\" Fao said.\nIt said the production outputs in the three countries are grim.\nFao warns that the growing number of refugees in East Africa will place even more burden on already strained food and nutrition security.\n\"Farmers in the region need urgent support to recover from consecutive lost harvests and to keep their breeding livestock healthy and productive at a time that pastures are the driest in years,\" it said.\nFao director for emergency and rehabilitation Dominique Burgeon said, \"We are dealing with a cyclical phenomenon in the Horn of Africa.\"\n\"But we also know from experience that timely support to farming families can significantly boost their ability to withstand the impacts of these droughts and soften the blow to their livelihoods,\" he said.\nBurgeon said Fao has already started disbursing emergency funds for rapid interventions in Kenya and Somalia in response to the situation.\nThe funds will support emergency feed and vaccinations for breeding and weak animals, repair water points, provide seeds and tools to plant in the spring season.\nFao is also working with officials to bolster countries' emergency preparedness across the region, targeting areas mostly hit by natural hazards.\nKenya is highly likely to see another drought in early 2017, and with it a rise in food insecurity.\nCurrent estimates show 1.3 million people are food insecure, but the Kenya Red Cross estimates the number would hit 2.5 million.\nFao said the impacts of the current drought in the southern part of the country will lessen by mid-2017, but counties in the North - in particular Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera - will steadily get worse.\n\"Families in these areas are heavily dependent on livestock. Now, with their livelihoods already stressed - the last reliable rain they received was in December 2015- they will get little relief from the October-December short rains, which typically mark a recovery period but once again fell short this season,\"it said.\nFAO says the terms of trade are unfavourable for livestock keepers, as prices of staple foods are rising, while a flood of weakened sheep, goats and cows onto local markets has brought down livestock prices.\nTo ensure livestock markets remain functional throughout the dry season in 2017, FAO, is training local officials in better managing livestock markets -- in addition to providing feed, water and veterinary support.\nFAO described the situation in Somalia as \"grim\" a matter made worse, by the country's driest season expected to begin at Jilaal in January and is expected to be even harsher than usual.\nSome five million Somalis are food insecure through December 2016.\nThis includes 1.1 million people in Crisis and Emergency conditions of food insecurity.\nFAO said farming families in Ethiopia are extremely vulnerable as they have not been able to recover from the 2015 El Nino-induced drought.\nSome 5.6 million people remain food insecure, while millions more depend on livestock herds that need to be protected and treated to improve milk and meat production. Here, too, better access to feed and water is critical.",

        "url": "http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/12/21/e-water-project-cuts-waste-and-eases-drought-in-ganze_c1475066", 
        "text": "More than 14,000 drought-stricken Ganze constituency in Kilifi county on Friday began drinking electronic water, a project introduced by the Kenya Red Cross Society. The project enables residents to use automated electronic cards filled with tokes to buy water.\nFunded by the International Committee of the Red Cross, it was launched at Mbudzi-Mayowe-Chivara (Mbumachi) areas in Jaribuni, Ganze subcounty.\nIt is expected to help solve the perennial water problems in the area, which is known as one of the worst-hit by drought and famine in the country.\nHow it works\nThe system is similar to the use of an automated teller machine to withdraw cash. One has to buy tokens from vendors and fill in their cards to buy water of up to 20 litres. Then one places the e-card at the point of filling, which has a censor.\nWater starts flowing automatically until it reaches the amount set. If one goes with a five-litre or 10-litre container, the system stops immediately the container is full.\nIn the normal supply system, people waste a lot of water cleaning their containers or filling them until they overflow. In the new system, they cannot waste any water as everything is set to fit the 20-litre jerricane.\nOn Friday, the KRCS and ICRCS officially handed over the project to the Kilifi government. Governor Amason Kingi presided over the ceremony, which was also attended by senior county officials, area MP Peter Shehe and several MCAs. Also present were KRCS secretary general Abbas Gullet, Coast regional manager Hassan Musa and representatives of donors.\nGullet said the project is the first one the KRCS has carried out in the area and was piloted in Kilifi and Tana River counties. KRCS experts said the electronic water system is cost-effective and reduces loss of non-revenue water, as the taps stops refilling immediately the 20-litre limit is reached.\nNo kiosks necessary\nKRCS project manager Hakima Masoud told journalists they have set up five water points. Traditionally these would be water kiosks, which normally cost about Sh400,000 per unit, where the vendor is supposed to construct a building and pay a bill to the water company monthly.\nUnlike those kiosks, which sometimes are closed if the vendor fails to pay bills, the new system does not require kiosks. It has a system fitted with a prepaid system and a prepaid metre.\nMasoud said the new system will help to solve problems of non-revenue water loss and shortages caused by the vendor failing to pay bills.\n\"Every person shall have the authority to use water. One does also not need specific knowledge to use the card, just top up the tokens and buy water at the point of operation,'' she said.\nAlready the Red Cross has established vendors who are selling tokens and teaching residents on how to use the cards.\nSolar power\nAt the centre, the prepaid system uses solar power to ensure they are powered throughout to avoid inconveniencies caused by electricity blackouts.\nMoreover, the KRCS installed solar panels at the pumping station to alternate electricity, particularly during blackouts, to ensure a smooth flow of water throughout.\nGullet urged the county and the national government officials, particularly the governor and the MP, to push for and add funds to help the Red Cross expand the project.\nHe said the KRCS has already set up five water points and plans to add 10 others to reach more people who have difficulties in getting water.\nGullet welcomed the presence of national and county officials, who are normally rivals. \"Today, my happiness is to see all leaders together, especially the MP and the governor, on matters of development not politics. Residents need to be served,'' he said.\nGullet urged politicians to put aside their political interests for the benefit of the people.\nOn the electronic water project, the secretary general said it was the first time they were utilising water technology in the villages and they intend to take it to other parts of the country.\nHe said the move aims to reduce the hurdles experienced by residents who struggle to get relief during famine and struggle to get water.\nGullet said last month, they started the cash-transfer programme in Ganze, targeting 6,000 people who will get Sh6000 monthly.\nHe said they also intend to come up with another major water project in Bamba, which will assist more than 80,000 people.\nFunding the water\nKingi said the electronic water project is important to residents and promised to push for funds from his government to implement the project.\n\"In the big towns, people go to ATMs with the aim of withdrawing cash, but here, they will use the ATMs to withdraw water,\" he said.\nThe governor said the county will sit with KRCS officials to look for funds quickly to do the e-water project.\n\"In the last three years, there has been a marked transformation in terms of access to clean and portable water in Kilifi county. We have made deliberate efforts to inject funds to help develop Kilifi better,\" he said.\n\"In this financial year, we have set aside more than Sh600 million for key water projects to solve the perennial water problem in Ganze and Magarini.\"\nDevolved services\nKingi urged the national government to \"stop hanging onto devolved functions\", saying it derailed development in counties. He said the Jubilee government has been implementing laws that are directed to take away powers from county governments so it can keep controlling billions of shillings.\n\"Functions such as water, roads and health are devolved, and it is the duty of the county government to oversee these services. But still, the national government wants to control these services. What we need is to work together to see that we serve our people and improve their lives,\" he said.\nShehe said leaders and residents should take care of the project.\nThe project will now be managed by the Kilifi Water and Sewerage Company, which is under the county government.",

        "text": "In the scorching sun, Alphonce Abok keeps an eye on his fields of watermelons growing near the banks of the Sound River, one of the major channels feeding into Lake Victoria.\n\"I hope with enough water this time around I will harvest my watermelons,\" said the farmer from western Kenya. Not so long ago, he said, his efforts failed as he couldn't get enough water to the crop.\nIn July, however, he purchased a solar-powered irrigation pump that he now hopes will give him a much more reliable harvest.\nThe equipment, from Futurepump, which imports irrigation kits from India, draws energy from an 80-watt solar panel mounted on a metal frame. The solar power then drives a motor that pulls water from a river, well or storage tank.\nAbok used to use a diesel irrigation pump that cost nearly $10 a day in fuel to run, and often drained his budget, as well as being noisy and smoky, he said.\nHis new $637 pump required a $414 down payment, with $25 a month repayments until it is paid off.\nThe price tag can make the pumps hard to afford for many small farmers, but Futurepump, based in Kisumu, has set up loan programmes with banks and micro-finance institutions to help buyers acquire the equipment, said Charles Ahenda-Bengo, the company's general manager.\nThe firm also hopes to eventually begin manufacturing the solar irrigation kits locally, to help cut costs, Ahenda-Bengo said.\nCheaper than losses\nThe solar pump was designed specifically for small-scale farmers who can't afford the irrigation technology used by large farmers, but who increasingly need to irrigate their crops as rainfall becomes more irregular, he said.\nSo far, the company has sold 200 pumps in Kenya. Another 350 have been sold in other East African countries, Ahenda-Bengo said.\nRachael Opiyo, another farmer who bought one of the solar pumps with her savings this year, fears the high up-front cost may keep many farmers from investing in the technology.\nBut Ahenda-Bengo said the kit, which is guaranteed for five years, is less expensive if considered over its potential lifespan - and cheaper than losing crops repeatedly.\nJoshua Okundi, another farmer who has bought a solar pump, said the device is saving time as well as cash, as the diesel pump engine levels don't need to be topped up.\n\"With the solar irrigation pump my work is easier since I don't have to monitor it every time. I just place the kit in the farm and leave it to continue pumping water,\" he said.\nGovernment irrigation push\nPatrick Nduati, the principal secretary for irrigation in Kenya's Ministry of Water, said the government is not charging value-added tax on such solar kits, and that the country's draft National Irrigation Policy proposes offering more incentives to farmers to buy such devices, including lower import taxes.\nIrrigation has the potential to boost and protect production on many small farms, Nduati said. Already the country has about 3,600 smallholder irrigation projects covering 168,000 acres, or about 42 percent of the country's total irrigated area.\nBut while solar pumps are a welcome addition in Kenya, Nduati said, they have not always worked in conditions where the sun doesn't shine. Farmers like Abok and Okundi believe adding a rechargeable battery to the kit could help solve the problem.\nBut Ahenda-Bengo said adding more features would defeat the solar kit's purpose by making it harder to transport and use. The current relatively simple kit, he said, is easy for farmers to repair themselves.\nNduati said the government plans to boost agricultural production in Kenya, despite problems with drought, by placing 100,000 additional acres of land under irrigation each year through the year 2030.\nThat would be managed, in part, by boosting spending on irrigation to around 2 percent of the national budget, and finding new water sources by harvesting rainwater and re-using waste water, he said.",

National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich signed on behalf of the Kenyan government, while the EU Commissioner in charge of International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica signed on behalf of the EU.\nAbout Sh2.1 billion will be pumped into the operationalisation of the Kenya's Ending Drought Emergencies Strategy - an ambitious plan by the Jubilee administration to end \"the worst of the suffering by drought\" by 2022.\nThe strategy, developed jointly between the government and the development partners, focuses on the 23 most-prone counties, the statement said.\n\"The proposed programme will also promote the establishment of Public Private Community Partnerships to increase the role of the private sector in the construction and management of water supply services,\" the dispatch added.\nNearly half of the cash, Sh5.3 billion, will be spent to support productive, adapted, and market integrated smallholder agriculture .The programme builds on the ongoing 10th EDF Kenya Rural Development Programme and the standards and market access project. It is aimed at supporting smallholder productivity and resilience, agricultural research and services, food quality and safety.\nThe EDF grant support will target provision of water services and training to enable smallholder investment on farm, as well as reduce financial risks by way of interest subsidies. According to the statement, about Sh3.6 billion will be used in the programme for legal empowerment and aid delivery.\nThe programme targets the counties with the five largest urban centres , and seven counties of the most marginalised areas.\n\"It seeks to address the linkage between marginalisation of communities concerned and their exposure to criminal activities,\" the statement read.\n\n",
